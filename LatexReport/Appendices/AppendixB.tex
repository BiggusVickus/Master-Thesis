\chapter{Appendix B: Industrial and Real Life Applications of Phages} 
\label{AppendixB} 

Due to the nature of killing bacteria, there are numerous applications where a researcher or an organization might be interested in controlling bacterial populations.

A Food Safety Specialist might be interested in introducing a solution containing a high concentration of phages during food production to prevent the spread and growth of \textit{Salmonella} or \textit{E. coli} in the pet food. 
Alternatively, the Food Safety Specialist might want to promote beneficial bacteria like \textit{Streptococcus thermophilus}, used in the production of Emmental cheese, which heat would kill during the pasteurization process. 

A doctor might be interested in providing swallowable pills, more commonly known as phage cocktails, to a patient with a bacterial infection.
There is evidence that phage-resistant bacteria are more susceptible to antibiotics; therefore, the doctor might prescribe both medicines to treat the infection effectively. 

An Environmental Protection Officer might be interested in seeing how they can use phages to stop the spread of \textit{Cyanobacteria} blooms in waterways, more commonly known as blue-green algae, a photosynthetic microscopic organism that is technically classified as a type of bacteria.
This would keep waterways safe for boating and swimming activity, aquatic life, and water consumption in farms, factories, and homes. 

When there are a few known bacterial strains, a targeted cocktail of phages can be used to control bacterial population growth in any setting, whether it be food, healthcare, or the environment.
Phages offer properties of microbial control that other methods do not, making them an ideal candidate for some applications. 

\section{Controlling Foodborne Bacteria}
\label{sec:AppendixB:controlling_foodborne_bacteria}
Foodborne diseases are one of the primary ways for bacteria to spread to humans and animals.
Some bacteria use the food as a vector to infect hosts, while others deposit toxins on the food, which is then ingested.
If consumed in large enough quantities or further produced in the host, the toxins can be fatal to the host.

Methods exist to control bacterial growth, for example, by storing food at temperatures below 5\textdegree C or above 60\textdegree C.
Bacteria need moisture to grow, so starches like rice will have minimal bacterial growth.
Bacteria prefer to live in slightly acidic to neutral pH environments; therefore, having an extremely acidic environment, such as vinegar, will prevent bacterial growth.
The use of chemical antibacterial agents, such as bleach, is undesirable due to the potential for leaving residues on food, which can be fatal if ingested.
Physical entities like heat or radiation can kill bacteria, but at the cost of altering the food quality \cite{fieseler_food_2021}. 

For example, \textit{Streptococcus thermophilus} is one of three different bacteria strains used to create Emmental cheese.
However, Emmental cheese does not use pasteurized milk, which increases the risk of \textit{E. coli}.
Emmental cheese producers can add phages that target \textit{E. coli} to the milk during the production stage while not affecting the bacteria used to produce the cheese. 

\subsection{Current Applications}
Phage cocktails like SalmoFresh\textsuperscript{TM} have been proven to safely reduce \textit{Salmonella} contamination in pet food and raw pet food ingredients \cite{sofferBacteriophagesSafelyReduce2016}, as well as in romaine lettuce and bean sprouts \cite{zhangSalmoFreshEffectivenessControlling2019}.
Pet food contains meat and vegetables, where vegetables grown in or on the ground are at risk of \textit{Salmonella} due to contact with soil, manure, compost, and other agricultural runoff from neighboring farms \cite{kowalskaFreshVegetablesFruit2023}.
\Cref{fig:SalmoFresh_in_pet_food} and \Cref{fig:SalmoFresh_effectiveness_lettuce_sprouts} show how the application of phages has reduced the count of \textit{Salmonella} in ingredients used in pet food as well as romaine lettuce and bean sprouts. 
In \Cref{fig:SalmoFresh_in_pet_food}, each food group noticed at least a 68\% reduction in CFU/g compared to the control when the $9\times 10^6$ phage treatment was applied. 
There was at least an 80\% reduction in CFU/g across all food groups when treated with a concentration of $9\times 10^6$ or stronger. 
In \Cref{fig:SalmoFresh_effectiveness_lettuce_sprouts}, the lettuce and bean sprouts noticed a reduction of at least 0.6 log CFU/mL in \textit{Salmonella} count across all temperature ranges. 
The most significant reduction in bacterial count in lettuce was observed at 1 hour at 2\textdegree C with an absolute reduction of 62.0\% between the control and treatment. 
The most significant reduction in bacteria of 90.0\% was observed at 72 hours at 2\textdegree C. 
For the bean sprouts, the lowest reduction in phages was found at 1 hour at 2\textdegree C with a reduction of 78.1\%, and the most significant reduction was 90.0\% at 25\textdegree C after 48 hours. 
Although these values are still above the food-safe threshold, the ability to reduce the \textit{Salmonella} population by at least 62\% and up to 90\% at various temperatures and incubation periods is impressive. It can prolong shelf life, especially for foods that have short shelf lives before spoiling due to bacterial growth. 
As such, phages can be shown to control the spread of \textit{Salmonella} in food sources and extend the potential shelf life of certain foods.

\section{Phage Therapy and Antibiotics}
\label{sec:AppendixB:phage_therapy_and_antibiotics}
Antibiotics are a common treatment for bacterial infections.
However, antibiotics are not selective in the bacteria they kill, killing both harmful and beneficial bacteria.
This can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which makes it harder to combat those bacteria in the future.
It has also been demonstrated that antibiotics can harm the gut microbiome and brain development in mice.
Phages are an alternative to antibiotics, as they are selective in the bacteria they kill and do not interact with cells or other important biological functions.
The rise in antibiotic-resistant bacteria can be attributed to the overuse and overprescription of antibiotics, as well as incorrect usage (for example, prematurely stopping) \cite{odonkorBacteriaResistanceAntibiotics2011}.
These actions exert evolutionary pressure on bacteria to mutate and develop resistance to antibiotics. 
Phage therapy can contain any number of different phages that target specific bacterial infections, such as \textit{Streptococcus pneumoniae}, with minimal risk of side effects.

\subsection{Current Applications: Bacterial Infection Control}
One active area of research is the use of phages to control bacterial infections.
Due to the specificity of phages, they can be used to target specific bacteria strains without affecting other beneficial bacteria.
When sick with a bacterial infection, patients swallow antibiotic pills to help the body fight the infection.
Antibiotics work by either interrupting intercellular processes like the synthesis of RNA \cite{flossRifamycinModeActionResistance2005}, by disrupting the structural integrity of the cell wall \cite{tomaszMechanismIrreversibleAntimicrobial1979}, or by inhibiting protein synthesis \cite{vakulenkoVersatilityAminoglycosidesProspects2003}.

However, antibiotics are not strain-specific and indiscriminately kill other bacteria as well.
Common side effects of antibiotics, although usually not serious, include diarrhea, nausea, and headaches.
It has also been shown that the effects of early-stage penicillin exposure in mice have been found to have a long-lasting effect on the gut microbiome, frontal cortex gene expression, and amygdala gene expression \cite{volkovaEffectsEarlylifePenicillin2021}.
Penicillin increases cytokine expression (small proteins involved in cell signaling) in the frontal cortex of the brain, modifies the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, and alters behavior.
The mice exhibited an increase in aggression and anxiety-like behavior \cite{leclercqLowdosePenicillinEarly2017}.
Phages can be used as an alternative to antibiotics, offering benefits without side effects and without affecting the gut microbiome. 

With an increase in antibiotic use, there has been a corresponding rise in antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
The World Health Organization has stated that antibiotic resistance poses a significant threat to modern medicine and the sustainability of an effective, global public health response to the enduring challenge of infectious diseases.
Common infections that previously would have been easy to treat are more complicated to treat and can increase the risk of disease spread, severe illness, and death \cite{GlobalActionPlan}. 

One area of research is exploring how bacteria can exchange traits such as phage resistance and antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria are multi-drug resistant and no longer respond to the medicine.

\citet{laurePhageResistancemediatedTradeoffs2022} showed evidence that \textit{Salmonella Typhimurium} is more susceptible to ampicillin in the presence of phages, and phage-resistance can lead to reduced virulence and decreased antibiotic resistance. 

\citet{zhaoPhagedrivenCoevolutionReveals2024} showed that there exists an antagonist coevolution between the bacteria and phages, where the dynamics changed from an arms race dynamic (ARD) to a fluctuating selection dynamics (FSD).
Due to phage selection and bacterial competition pressure, when bacteria gained phage resistance, they often lost antibiotic resistance.
Genome analysis revealed mutations in the \ textit {btuB} gene of \textit{Salmonella anatum}, with a higher mutation frequency during the ARD stage.
A knockout experiment confirmed that the btuB gene is a receptor for the \textit{JNwz02} phage, resulting in reduced bacterial competitiveness.
Further analysis detected multiple single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutations in the phage-resistant strains.
The SNPs potentially affected the membrane components, partially weakening the cell defense against antibiotics.
These findings help advance our understanding of phage-host-antibiotics interactions and the impact of adaptations to antibiotic resistance.
The research demonstrates how phages can be utilized to reintroduce antibiotic susceptibility to previously insusceptible bacteria, thereby preventing costly and lengthy research on new antibiotics \cite{zhaoPhagedrivenCoevolutionReveals2024}. 

Phage research is facing challenges due to bacterial strains evolving resistance to phages.
Understanding the interplay between antibiotics and phages is essential for shaping future research \cite{zhaoPhagedrivenCoevolutionReveals2024}.


\section{Environmental Protection}
\label{sec:AppendixB:environmental_protection}
Algae blooms, also called red tides, is the rapid spread of bacterial or algae organisms.
Blooms are a growing environmental concern impacting water quality, aquatic ecosystems, and human health.
These rapid increases in algae populations, often fueled by excess nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, can occur in freshwater, coastal, and marine environments. 

Cyanobacteria blooms have significant impacts on both the aquatic environment and human health.
Cyanobacteria release nitrogen and phosphorous, which the bacteria use to grow with oxygen, outpacing other aquatic growth and killing aquatic marine life.
Bacterial toxins can make their way into the food and water consumed by humans, causing muscle fatigue, respiratory issues, liver damage, and gastrointestinal issues \cite{zhangImpactCyanobacteriaBlooms2022}.
\Cref{fig:cyanobacteria_bloom_cycle} shows the process of how cyanobacteria degrade and are absorbed into the environment, eventually making their way into the human body via various contact points.
 
\begin{figure}

    \label{fig:cyanobacteria_bloom_cycle}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Current Applications}
 There is interest in using phages to control cyanobacteria blooms.
Phages can offer better and safer alternatives to chemical options when attempting to control bacterial blooms.
Chemical options are indiscriminate, killing cyanobacteria while also killing other beneficial bacteria and aquatic life, and can eventually seep into groundwater.
Although not used to control bacteria blooms, some chemicals like PFAS, also called “Forever Chemicals”, can last a long time in the environment and do not degrade and keep on negatively affecting the environment.
Due to the specificity of phages, only cyanobacteria will be targeted, and this will not affect the surrounding environment. 

Tucker and Pollard found that an isolated phage cocktail collected from Lake Baroon in Australia could decrease the abundance of \textit{M. aeruginosa} by 95\% within 6 days in a lab setting, before recovering within 3 weeks \cite{tuckerIdentificationCyanophageMaLBP2005}. 

There is evidence that phage-resistant bacteria can influence the population dynamics of other bacteria.
It has been shown that the plankton level has been experimentally affected by the frequency of the phage-resistant \textit{Nodularia} marine bacteria.
Populations with high phage resistance ($>50\%$) dominate the plankton communities despite a high phage count and eventually outcompete other bacteria due to their slower decline in population size.
Contrastingly, populations of bacteria with low phage resistance (between 0\% and 5\%) were lysed to extinction, releasing resources such as nitrogen.
This allows for other bacterial strains to absorb the resources and dominate the bacterial community.
Phages and the lysis of bacterial strains can have a dramatic effect on the community dynamics and composition of other entities, such as phages, bacteria, and resources \cite{colomaFrequencyVirusresistantHosts2019}.
Phages have the potential to be used as a specific strategy for controlling cyanobacterial blooms with minimal environmental impact, offering control of bacterial blooms with limited environmental impact.
Usage should be safe, novel, efficient, and sensitive.  

However, there are issues with using phages to control bacterial blooms.
Bacterial blooms can cover vast areas or occur in areas that are difficult to reach, such as marshlands; applying phages to combat the bloom may be infeasible.
If the method of choice were to spray a solution of water containing phages, the solution would need to be shipped to the site and loaded onto special boats to spray the solution into the water, or the trucks would need to drive along the shore and spray the solution into the water.
This solution may not address the root cause, for example, the constant discharge of wastewater into a river. 

The phage density in the solution must be relatively high to combat the bloom quickly.
These problems pose significant logistical challenges in creating the phages in a lab or factory, transporting them, and administering the phages to the waterways.
Phages can only diffuse through the water and cannot actively swim, so they are dependent on the rate of diffusion and water currents.
This will be difficult in marshlands, where the bacteria can “hide” in the grass and crevices created by aquatic life.
If the bloom occurs in a high-current area, such as a river or a bay, the water can wash the phages away.

Scientists have not yet fully understood the phage infection mechanism, and research into the artificial engineering of phages is limited, making it challenging to conduct studies in this area \cite{grassoReviewCyanophageHost2022, mckindlesDissolvedMicrocystinRelease2020}.
 
Algae can produce toxins that threaten wildlife, contaminate drinking water, and disrupt local economies dependent on fishing and tourism.
In the state of Florida, between the years 1995 and 2000, the restaurant and hotel industry lost an estimated $\$6.5$ million to algae blooms.
This accounts for approximately 25\% of the average total monthly sales revenue in the region from June through October, the months most commonly affected by red tide\cite{PDFEconomicImpacts}.
During a red bloom event, hospital diagnoses in the county of Sarasota for pneumonia, gastrointestinal, and respiratory illness increased by 19\%, 40\% and 54\% respectively \cite{chengCharacterizationMarineAerosol2005, kirkpatrickGastrointestinalEmergencyRoom2010}, with a respiratory illness visit costing between $\$0.5$ and $\$4$ million \cite{hoaglandCostsRespiratoryIllnesses2009}.
