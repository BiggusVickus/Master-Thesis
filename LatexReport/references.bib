  abstract = {In exploring bacterial resistance to bacteriophages, emphasis typically is placed on those mechanisms which completely prevent phage replication. Such resistance can be detected as extensive reductions in phage ability to form plaques, that is, reduced efficiency of plating. Mechanisms include restriction-modification systems, CRISPR/Cas systems, and abortive infection systems. Alternatively, phages may be reduced in their ``vigor'' when infecting certain bacterial hosts, that is, with phages displaying smaller burst sizes or extended latent periods rather than being outright inactivated. It is well known, as well, that most phages poorly infect bacteria that are less metabolically active. Extracellular polymers such as biofilm matrix material also may at least slow phage penetration to bacterial surfaces. Here I suggest that such ``less-robust'' mechanisms of resistance to bacteriophages could serve bacteria by slowing phage propagation within bacterial biofilms, that is, delaying phage impact on multiple bacteria rather than necessarily outright preventing such impact. Related bacteria, ones that are relatively near to infected bacteria, e.g., roughly 10+ {\textmu}m away, consequently may be able to escape from biofilms with greater likelihood via standard dissemination-initiating mechanisms including erosion from biofilm surfaces or seeding dispersal/central hollowing. That is, given localized areas of phage infection, so long as phage spread can be reduced in rate from initial points of contact with susceptible bacteria, then bacterial survival may be enhanced due to bacteria metaphorically ``running away'' to more phage-free locations. Delay mechanisms---to the extent that they are less specific in terms of what phages are targeted---collectively could represent broader bacterial strategies of phage resistance versus outright phage killing, the latter especially as require specific, evolved molecular recognition of phage presence. The potential for phage delay should be taken into account when developing protocols of phage-mediated biocontrol of biofilm bacteria, e.g., as during phage therapy of chronic bacterial infections.},

  abstract = {Bacteriophages typically have small genomes1 and depend on their bacterial hosts for replication2. Here we sequenced DNA from diverse ecosystems and found hundreds of phage genomes with lengths of more than 200~kilobases (kb), including a genome of 735~kb, which is---to our knowledge---the largest phage genome to be described to date. Thirty-five genomes were manually curated to completion (circular and no gaps). Expanded genetic repertoires include diverse and previously undescribed CRISPR--Cas systems, transfer RNAs (tRNAs), tRNA synthetases, tRNA-modification enzymes, translation-initiation and elongation factors, and ribosomal proteins. The CRISPR--Cas systems of phages have the capacity to silence host transcription factors and translational genes, potentially as part of a larger interaction network that intercepts translation to redirect biosynthesis to phage-encoded functions. In addition, some phages may repurpose bacterial CRISPR--Cas systems to eliminate competing phages. We phylogenetically define the major clades of huge phages from human and other animal microbiomes, as well as from oceans, lakes, sediments, soils and the built environment. We conclude that the large gene inventories of huge phages reflect a conserved biological strategy, and that the phages are distributed across a broad bacterial host range and across Earth's ecosystems.},

How bacterial cyclases recognize phage infection is not known. Here we show that staphylococcal phages produce a structured RNA transcribed from the terminase subunit genes, termed CBASS-activating bacteriophage RNA (cabRNA), which binds to a positively charged surface of the CdnE03 cyclase and promotes the synthesis of the cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP to activate the CBASS immune response. Phages that escape the CBASS defence harbour mutations that lead to the generation of a longer form of the cabRNA that cannot activate CdnE03. Since mammalian oligoadenylate synthetases also bind viral double-stranded RNA during the interferon response, our results reveal a conserved mechanism for the activation of innate antiviral defence pathways.},

Based on our results, we recommend calibrating OD to estimated cell count using serial dilution of silica microspheres, which produces highly precise calibration (95.5\% of residuals ~{$<$}1.2-fold), is easily assessed for quality control, also assesses instrument effective linear range, and can be combined with fluorescence calibration to obtain units of Molecules of Equivalent Fluorescein (MEFL) per cell, allowing direct comparison and data fusion with flow cytometry measurements: in our study, fluorescence per cell measurements showed only a 1.07-fold mean difference between plate reader and flow cytometry data.},

In recent years, the cyanophages and cyanobacteria interactions drew attention to environmental restoration due to their discovery in marine and freshwater systems. Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) are increasing throughout the world and contaminating aquatic ecosystems. The blooms cause severe environmental problems including unpleasant odors and cyanotoxin production. Cyanotoxins have been reported to be lethal agents for living beings and can harm animals, people, aquatic species, recreational activities, and drinking water reservoirs. Biological remediation of cyanoHABs in aquatic systems is a sustainable and eco-friendly approach to increasing surface water quality. Therefore, this study compiles the fragmented information with the solution of removal of cyanoHABs using cyanophage therapy techniques. To date, scant information exists in terms of bloom formation, cyanophage occurrence, and mode of action to remediate cyanoHABs. Overall, this study illustrates cyanobacterial toxin production and its impacts on the environment, the mechanisms involved in the cyanophage-cyanobacteria interaction, and the application of cyanophages for the removal of toxic cyanobacterial blooms.},

  abstract = {We determined the responses of a model laboratory community to resource enrichment and compared these responses to the predictions of prey-dependent and ratio-dependent food chain models. Our model community consisted of Escherichia coli B and bacteriophage T4 in chemostats supplied with different concentrations of glucose. We observed the following responses to enrichment: (1) a large and highly significant increase in the equilibrium population density of the predator, bacteriophage T4, (2) a small but significant increase in the equilibrium population density of the prey, E. coli, and (3) a large and highly significant decrease in the stability of both the predator and prey populations. These responses were better predicted by a prey-dependent model (altered to include a time delay between consumption and reproduction by predators) than by a ratio-dependent model. Enrichment had a large effect on evolutionary change in our system. Enrichment significantly decreased the amount of time required for mutants of E. coli that were resistant to predation by bacteriophage to appear in the chemostats. Enrichment also significantly increased the rate at which these bacteriophage-resistant mutants invaded the chemostats. These results were also better predicted by the prey-dependent model. Invasion by bacteriophage-resistant mutants had a large effect on the subsequent population dynamics of both predator and prey. Both the equilibrium density and stability of the E. coli population increased following invasion, and the population shifted from being primarily limited by predators to being primarily limited by resources. After invasion by the mutants, the T4 population decreased in equilibrium density, and the population cycled with an increased period. These results were compared to the predictions of a ratio-dependent model and a prey-dependent model altered to include T4-resistant mutants. The dynamics of this community were better predicted by the modified prey-dependent model; however, this model was more complex mathematically than the simpler ratio-dependent model.},

  abstract = {Viruses numerically dominate our oceans; however, we have only just begun to document the diversity, host range and infection dynamics of marine viruses, as well as the subsequent effects of infection on both host cell metabolism and oceanic biogeochemistry. Bacteriophages (that is, phages: viruses that infect bacteria) are highly abundant and are known to play critical roles in bacterial mortality, biogeochemical cycling and horizontal gene transfer. This Review Article summarizes current knowledge of marine viral ecology and highlights the importance of phage particles to the dissolved organic matter pool, as well as the complex interactions between phages and their bacterial hosts. We emphasize the newly recognized roles of phages as puppet masters of their bacterial hosts, where phages are capable of altering the metabolism of infected bacteria through the expression of auxiliary metabolic genes and the redirection of host gene expression patterns. Finally, we propose the `royal family model' as a hypothesis to describe successional patterns of bacteria and phages over time in marine systems, where despite high richness and significant seasonal differences, only a small number of phages appear to continually dominate a given marine ecosystem. Although further testing is required, this model provides a framework for assessing the specificity and ecological consequences of phage--host dynamics.},

These factors will ultimately help us to understand the role these phages play as part of specific microbial communities, enabling the tracking of individual virus genomes through space and time.

Such alterations are facilitated by phage interactions with critical bacterial components involved in motility, adhesion, biofilm production, conjugation, antimicrobial resistance, and immune evasion. Therefore, the impact of SIE extends beyond the immediate defense against superinfection, influencing the overall fitness and virulence of the bacteria. Evaluating the interactions between phages and their bacterial targets is critical for leading phage therapy candidates like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative bacterium responsible for persistent and antibiotic-resistant opportunistic infections. However, comprehensive literature on the mechanisms underlying SIE remains scarce. Here, we provide a compilation of well-characterized and potential mechanisms employed by Pseudomonas phages to establish SIE. We hypothesize that the fitness costs imposed by SIE affect bacterial virulence, highlighting the potential role of this mechanism in the management of bacterial infections.},

Most importantly, the genetic basis of phenotype evolution is almost never understood, and phenotypic selection experiments are rarely possible. Both limitations can be overcome with bacteriophages. However, phages have such elementary life histories that few phenotypes seem appropriate for optimality approaches. Here we develop optimality models of two phage life history traits, lysis time and host range. The lysis time models show that the optimum is less sensitive to differences in host density than suggested by earlier analytical work. Host range evolution is approached from the perspective of whether the virus should avoid particular hosts, and the results match optimal foraging theory: there is an optimal ``diet'' in which host types are either strictly included or excluded, depending on their infection qualities. Experimental tests of both models are feasible, and phages provide concrete illustrations of many ways that optimality models can guide understanding and explanation. Phage genetic systems already support the perspective that lysis time and host range can evolve readily and evolve without greatly affecting other traits, one of the main tenets of optimality theory. The models can be extended to more general properties of infection, such as the evolution of virulence and tissue tropism.},

Here, we use simulation models to investigate whether spatial structure per se can account for this increased cell density in the presence of phages. A measure is derived for comparing cell densities between growth in spatially structured environments versus well mixed environments (known as mass action). Maintenance of sensitive cells requires some form of phage death; we invoke death mechanisms that are spatially fixed, as if produced by cells. Spatially structured phage death provides cells with a means of protection that can boost cell densities an order of magnitude above that attained under mass action, although the effect is sometimes in the opposite direction. Phage and bacteria self organize into separate refuges, and spatial structure operates so that the phage progeny from a single burst do not have independent fates (as they do with mass action). Phage incur a high loss when invading protected areas that have high cell densities, resulting in greater protection for the cells. By the same metric, mass action dynamics either show no sustained bacterial elevation or oscillate between states of low and high cell densities and an elevated average. The elevated cell densities observed in models with spatial structure do not approach the empirically observed increased density of cells in structured environments with phages (which can be many orders of magnitude), so the empirical phenomenon likely requires additional mechanisms than those analyzed here.},

(1) Phages are plentiful in nature. (2) They are structurally complex. (3) Besides temperate phages, there exist in bacteria other elements capable of multiplying in either an autonomous or an integrated state (episomes). (4) Phages and other episomes can incorporate bacterial genes. B. Various possible explanations for the continued existence of bacteriophage are examined. It is concluded that: (1) Phages probably have evolved as phages rather than representing transient offshoots of some other evolutionary line; (2) Their role in bacterial recombination may be the most important factor in assuring their survival. C. The function of some of the specialized structures of phages is discussed briefly, as is the question of reproductive isolation and speciation.}

We describe detailed characterization of aerosols during an epidemiologic study of occupational exposure to Florida red tide aerosol in terms of its concentration, toxin profile, and particle size distribution. This information is essential in understanding its source, assessing exposure to people, and estimating dose of inhaled aerosols. Environmental sampling confirmed the presence of brevetoxins in water and air during a red tide exposure period (September 2001) and lack of significant toxin levels in the water and air during an unexposed period May 2002). Water samples collected during a red tide bloom in 2001 showed moderate-to-high concentrations of K. brevis cells and PbTxs. The daily mean PbTx concentration in water samples ranged from 8 to 28 {$\mu$}g/L from 7 to 11 September 2001; the daily mean PbTx concentration in air samples ranged from 1.3 to 27 ng/m3. The daily aerosol concentration on the beach can be related to PbTx concentration in water, wind speed, and wind direction. Personal samples confirmed human exposure to red tide aerosols. The particle size distribution showed a mean aerodynamic diameter in the size range of 6--12 {$\mu$}m, with deposits mainly in the upper airways. The deposition pattern correlated with the observed increase of upper airway symptoms in healthy lifeguards during the exposure periods.},

  abstract = {A key unresolved question in microbial ecology is how the extraordinary diversity of microbiomes emerges from the interactions among their many functionally distinct populations. This process is driven in part by the cross-feeding networks that help to structure these systems, in which consumers use resources to fuel their metabolism, creating by-products which can be used by others in the community. Understanding the effects of cross-feeding presents a major challenge, as it creates complex interdependencies between populations which can be hard to untangle. We address this problem using the tools of network science to develop a structural microbial community model. Using methods from percolation theory, we identify feasible community states for cross-feeding network structures in which the needs of consumers are met by metabolite production across the community. We identify tipping points at which small changes in structure can cause the catastrophic collapse of cross-feeding networks and abrupt declines in microbial community diversity. Our results are an example of a well-defined tipping point in a complex ecological system and provide insight into the fundamental processes shaping microbiomes and their robustness. We further demonstrate this by considering how network attacks affect community diversity and apply our results to show how the apparent difficulty in culturing the microbial diversity emerges as an inherent property of their cross-feeding networks.},

  abstract = {Parasites, such as bacterial viruses (phages), can have large effects on host populations both at the ecological and evolutionary levels. In the case of cyanobacteria, phages can reduce primary production and infected hosts release intracellular nutrients influencing planktonic food web structure, community dynamics, and biogeochemical cycles. Cyanophages may be of great importance in aquatic food webs during large cyanobacterial blooms unless the host population becomes resistant to phage infection. The consequences on plankton community dynamics of the evolution of phage resistance in bloom forming cyanobacterial populations are still poorly studied. Here, we examined the effect of different frequencies of a phage-resistant genotype within a filamentous nitrogen-fixing Nodularia spumigena population on an experimental plankton community. Three Nodularia populations with different initial frequencies (0\%, 5\%, and 50\%) of phage-resistant genotypes were inoculated in separate treatments with the phage 2AV2, the green alga Chlorella vulgaris, and the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis, which formed the experimental plankton community subjected to either nitrogen-limited or nitrogen-rich conditions. We found that the frequency of the phage-resistant Nodularia genotype determined experimental community dynamics. Cyanobacterial populations with a high frequency (50\%) of the phage-resistant genotype dominated the cultures despite the presence of phages, retaining most of the intracellular nitrogen in the plankton community. In contrast, populations with low frequencies (0\% and 5\%) of the phage-resistant genotype were lysed and reduced to extinction by the phage, transferring the intracellular nitrogen held by Nodularia to Chlorella and rotifers, and allowing Chlorella to dominate the communities and rotifers to survive. This study shows that even though phages represent minuscule biomass, they can have key effects on community composition and eco-evolutionary feedbacks in plankton communities.},

  abstract = {Diverse phage-bacteria communities coexist at high densities in environmental, agricultural, and human-associated micro-biomes. Phage-bacteria coexistence is often attributed to coevolutionary processes mediated by complex, pairwise infection networks. Here, using in vitro experiments and mathematical models, we explore how higher-order interactions function as a complementary, ecological feedback mechanism to stabilize phage-bacteria communities. To do so, we examine an environmentally-derived, synthetic phage-bacteria community comprised of five marine heterotrophic bacteria (Cellulophaga baltica and Pseudoalteromonas strains) and five associated phage. We used Bayesian inference to reconstruct free phage production in one-step growth experiments and then forecasted pairwise phage-bacteria dynamics over multiple infection cycles. In contrast to model predictions of rapid bacterial population collapse, each bacterial strain persisted, consistent with density-dependent stabilization mechanisms at high virus densities. We then extended models into a community context and found an additional stabilization mechanism: life history traits differ in community vs. pairwise contexts. Follow-up experiments confirm that lysis is inhibited at relatively high viral densities and phage traits (including burst size) can shift when infecting single vs. multiple strains. More broadly, these findings suggest that complex community coexistence of phage and bacteria may be more common than anticipated when including feedback mechanisms outside of regimes of fitted pairwise models that do not reflect the full scope of ecologically relevant contexts.},

The widespread distribution of this type of metabolic interactions, however, is at odds with evolutionary theory: why should an organism invest costly resources to benefit other individuals rather than using these metabolites to maximize its own fitness? Recent empirical work has shown that bacterial genotypes can significantly benefit from trading metabolites with other bacteria relative to cells not engaging in such interactions. Here, we will provide a comprehensive overview over the ecological factors and evolutionary mechanisms that have been identified to explain the evolution and maintenance of metabolic mutualisms among microorganisms. Furthermore, we will highlight general principles that underlie the adaptive evolution of interconnected microbial metabolic networks as well as the evolutionary consequences that result for cells living in such communities.},

  abstract = {Significance             Bacteria are repeatedly exposed to an excess of phages and carry evidence of this in terms of multiple defense mechanisms encoded in their genome. In addition to molecular mechanisms, bacteria may exploit the defense of spatial refuges. Here we demonstrate how bacteria can limit the impact of a virulent phage attack by growing as a colony which exposes only its surface to phages. We identify a critical size of the initial colony, below which the phages entirely eliminate the colony and above which the colony continues to grow despite the presence of phages. Our study suggests that coexistence of phages and bacteria is strongly influenced by the spatial composition of microcolonies of susceptible bacteria.           ,                             Bacteria form colonies and secrete extracellular polymeric substances that surround the individual cells. These spatial structures are often associated with collaboration and quorum sensing between the bacteria. Here we investigate the mutual protection provided by spherical growth of a monoclonal colony during exposure to phages that proliferate on its surface. As a proof of concept we exposed growing colonies of               Escherichia coli               to a virulent mutant of phage P1. When the colony consists of less than                                                   {$\sim$}                                               50,000 members it is eliminated, while larger initial colonies allow long-term survival of both phage-resistant mutants and, importantly, colonies of mostly phage-sensitive members. A mathematical model predicts that colonies formed solely by phage-sensitive bacteria can survive because the growth of bacteria throughout the colony exceeds the killing of bacteria on the surface and pinpoints how the critical colony size depends on key parameters in the phage infection cycle.},

  abstract = {Bacteriophage shape the composition and function of microbial communities. Yet it remains difficult to predict the effect of phage on microbial interactions. Specifically, little is known about how phage influence mutualisms in networks of cross-feeding bacteria. We mathematically modeled the impacts of phage in a synthetic microbial community in which Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica exchange essential metabolites. In this model, independent phage attack of either species was sufficient to temporarily inhibit both members of the mutualism; however, the evolution of phage resistance facilitated yields similar to those observed in the absence of phage. In laboratory experiments, attack of S. enterica with P22vir phage followed these modeling expectations of delayed community growth with little change in the final yield of bacteria. In contrast, when E. coli was attacked with T7 phage, S. enterica, the nonhost species, reached higher yields compared with no-phage controls. T7 infection increased nonhost yield by releasing consumable cell debris, and by driving evolution of partially resistant E. coli that secreted more carbon. Our results demonstrate that phage can have extensive indirect effects in microbial communities, that the nature of these indirect effects depends on metabolic and evolutionary mechanisms, and that knowing the degree of evolved resistance leads to qualitatively different predictions of bacterial community dynamics in response to phage attack.},

That is, these are things that we intentionally take into our bodies, thereby potentially exposing our more internal tissues to these pathogens. Numerous bacterial pathogens are considered to be foodborne. These include but are not limited to Salmonella, several forms of pathogenic E. coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Campylobacter. Some bacteria, rather than cause infection, can form toxins, after growing in food prior to consumption, that sicken people. The most notorious of which is Clostridium botulinum where intoxication can prove fatal. More common but less serious intoxication occurs when certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus produce toxins in food. While preventing contamination of food with bacterial pathogens in the first place is desirable, e.g., by avoiding fecal contamination, it is also possible to minimize bacterial counts in foods following such contamination. The use of chemical antibacterial agents is problematic because many of these agents can also be harmful to consumers because chemical traces often will remain. Alternatives are various physical agents, including heat, pressure, and various forms of radiation as antibacterial agents, which have the virtue of not leaving behind residues, but nevertheless can be problematic because they modify the quality of so-treated foods. When pathogens of concern are only few in type, then more specific, highly targeted antibacterial agents may be employed. One such agent is bacteriophages, which have the virtue of neither modifying food quality nor leaving behind chemical residues. This chapter summarizes the application of bacteriophages in food to enhance food safety. Properties of suitable phages will be addressed and examples of the control of major food borne pathogenic bacteria are provided and discussed.},

  abstract = {Bacteriophages, or simply phages, are viruses infecting bacteria. With an estimated 1031 particles in the biosphere, phages outnumber bacteria by a factor of at least 10 and not surprisingly, they influence the evolution of most bacterial species, sometimes in unexpected ways. ``Temperate'' phages have the ability to integrate into the chromosome of their host upon infection, where they can reside as ``quiescent'' prophages until conditions favor their reactivation. Lysogenic conversion resulting from the integration of prophages encoding powerful toxins is probably the most determinant contribution of prophages to the evolution of pathogenic bacteria. We currently grasp only a small fraction of the total phage diversity. Phage biologists keep unraveling novel mechanisms developed by phages to parasitize their host. The purpose of this review is to give an overview of some of the various ways by which prophages change the lifestyle and boost virulence of some of the most dangerous bacterial pathogens.},

  abstract = {Traditional assays for counting bacteriophages and their lysogens are labor-intensive and perturbative to the host cells. Here, we present a high-throughput infection method in a microplate reader, where the growth dynamics of the infected culture is measured using the optical density (OD). We find that the OD at which the culture lyses scales linearly with the logarithm of the initial phage concentration, providing a way of measuring phage numbers over nine orders of magnitude and down to single-phage sensitivity. Interpreting the measured dynamics using a mathematical model allows us to infer the phage growth rate, which is a function of the phage-cell encounter rate, latent period, and burst size. Adding antibiotic selection provides the ability to measure the rate of host lysogenization. Using this method, we found that when E. coli growth slows down, the lytic growth rate of lambda phages decreases, and the propensity for lysogeny increases, demonstrating how host physiology influences the viral developmental program.},

A key finding from theoretical and in vitro studies is that host resistance evolves to greater levels with increased resources, but the relevance to natural communities is less clear. We took two complementary approaches to investigate the effect of resource availability on the evolution of bacterial resistance to phages in soil. First, we measured the resistance and infectivity of natural communities of soil bacteria and phage in the presence and absence of nutrient-providing plants. Second, we followed the real-time coevolution between defined bacteria and phage populations with resource availability manipulated by the addition or not of an artificial plant root exudate. Increased resource availability resulted in increases in bacterial resistance to phages, but without a concomitant increase in phage infectivity. These results suggest that phages may have a reduced impact on the control of bacterial densities and community composition in stable, high resource environments.},

Cyanobacteria HABs (cyanoHABs) negatively affect ecosystems and drinking water resources through the production of potent toxins. Furthermore, the frequency, duration, and distribution of cyanoHABs are increasing, and conditions that favor cyanobacteria growth are predicted to increase in the coming years. Current methods for mitigating cyanoHABs are generally short-lived and resource-intensive, and have negative impacts on non-target species. Cyanophages (viruses that specifically target cyanobacteria) have the potential to provide a highly specific control strategy with minimal impacts on non-target species and propagation in the environment. A detailed review (primarily up to 2020) of cyanophage lifecycle, diversity, and factors influencing infectivity is provided in this paper, along with a discussion of cyanophage and host cyanobacteria relationships for seven prominent cyanoHAB-forming genera in North America, including: Synechococcus, Microcystis, Dolichospermum, Aphanizomenon, Cylindrospermopsis, Planktothrix, and Lyngbya. Lastly, factors affecting the potential application of cyanophages as a cyanoHAB control strategy are discussed, including efficacy considerations, optimization, and scalability for large-scale applications.},

  abstract = {Success of phage therapies is limited by bacterial defenses against phages. While a large variety of anti- phage defense mechanisms has been characterized, how expression of these systems is distributed across individual cells and how their combined activities translate into protection from phages has not been studied. Using bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing, we profiled the transcriptomes of {$\sim$}50,000 cells from cultures of a human pathobiont, Bacteroides fragilis, infected with a lytic bacteriophage. We quantified the asynchronous progression of phage infection in single bacterial cells and reconstructed the infection timeline, characterizing both host and phage transcriptomic changes as infection unfolded. We discovered a subpopulation of bacteria that remained uninfected and determined the heterogeneously expressed host factors associated with protection. Each cell's vulnerability to phage infection was defined by combinatorial phase-variable expression of multiple genetic loci, including capsular polysaccharide (CPS) biosynthesis pathways, restriction-modification systems (RM), and a previously uncharacterized operon likely encoding fimbrial genes. By acting together, these heterogeneously expressed phase-variable systems and anti-phage defense mechanisms create a phenotypic landscape where distinct protective combinations enable the survival and re-growth of bacteria expressing these phenotypes without acquiring additional mutations. The emerging model of complementary action of multiple protective mechanisms heterogeneously expressed across an isogenic bacterial population showcases the potent role of phase variation and stochasticity in bacterial anti-phage defenses. One Sentence Summary Combinatorial phenotypic states with differential vulnerability to phage infection across a Bacteroides fragilis population enable a small number of super-resistant bacterial cells to evade the phage without the need for acquiring mutations.},

  abstract = {Many pathogenic bacteria utilize dynamic appendages called pili to facilitate important functions, such as gene transfer and motility. These processes contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance genes and support persistence in bacterial infections, making them prime targets for therapeutic purposes. The single-stranded (ss) RNA bacteriophages all use dynamic pili to facilitate infection; however, key mechanistic details describing how the pilus promotes viral entry into the host cell have remained elusive. Here we used fluorescence microscopy to uncover a telling phenomenon associated with ssRNA phage infection: initial penetration of the viral payload causes breakage of host pili. This provides a selective advantage for the infecting phage, and thus this phenomenon may be widespread among other pilus-specific phage systems., Although the F-specific ssRNA phage MS2 has long had paradigm status, little is known about penetration of the genomic RNA (gRNA) into the cell. The phage initially binds to the F-pilus using its maturation protein (Mat), and then the Mat-bound gRNA is released from the viral capsid and somehow crosses the bacterial envelope into the cytoplasm. To address the mechanics of this process, we fluorescently labeled the ssRNA phage MS2 to track F-pilus dynamics during infection. We discovered that ssRNA phage infection triggers the release of F-pili from host cells, and that higher multiplicity of infection (MOI) correlates with detachment of longer F-pili. We also report that entry of gRNA into the host cytoplasm requires the F-plasmid--encoded coupling protein, TraD, which is located at the cytoplasmic entrance of the F-encoded type IV secretion system (T4SS). However, TraD is not essential for pilus detachment, indicating that detachment is triggered by an early step of MS2 engagement with the F-pilus or T4SS. We propose a multistep model in which the ssRNA phage binds to the F-pilus and through pilus retraction engages with the distal end of the T4SS channel at the cell surface. Continued pilus retraction pulls the Mat-gRNA complex out of the virion into the T4SS channel, causing a torsional stress that breaks the mature F-pilus at the cell surface. We propose that phage-induced disruptions of F-pilus dynamics provides a selective advantage for infecting phages and thus may be prevalent among the phages specific for retractile pili.},

Three strains of the filamentous bacterium Gordonia amarae, isolated from wastewater treatment plants, were investigated to determine their effect on foam formation and stabilisation. During the exponential phase of the bacterial growth a biosurfactant was formed, causing a significant drop in the surface tension of the filtered medium and the formation of persistent foam. Foaming tests in the presence and absence of bacteria showed that bacteria increased foam persistence, most probably by reducing the drainage from the lamellae between bubbles. Experiments showed that {$>$} or =55\% of the three bacterial strains partitioned into the foam produced by the biosurfactant, indicating that their surfaces were hydrophobic. The extent of partitioning was independent of the growth stage, suggesting that the cell surface hydrophobicity did not change with age, or with cell viability. This work shows that, although the G. amarae cells themselves do not cause foaming, they do produce biosurfactant, which aids foam formation, and they stabilise the foam by reducing the rate of drainage from the foam lamellae.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Algal blooms of Karenia brevis, a harmful marine algae, occur almost annually off the west coast of Florida. At high concentrations, K. brevis blooms can cause harm through the release of potent toxins, known as brevetoxins, to the atmosphere. Epidemiologic studies suggest that aerosolized brevetoxins are linked to respiratory illnesses in humans. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized a relationship between K. brevis blooms and respiratory illness visits to hospital emergency departments (EDs) while controlling for environmental factors, disease, and tourism. We sought to use this relationship to estimate the costs of illness associated with aerosolized brevetoxins. METHODS: We developed a statistical exposure-response model to express hypotheses about the relationship between respiratory illnesses and bloom events. We estimated the model with data on ED visits, K. brevis cell densities, and measures of pollen, pollutants, respiratory disease, and intra-annual population changes. RESULTS: We found that lagged K. brevis cell counts, low air temperatures, influenza outbreaks, high pollen counts, and tourist visits helped explain the number of respiratory-specific ED diagnoses. The capitalized estimated marginal costs of illness for ED respiratory illnesses associated with K. brevis blooms in Sarasota County, Florida, alone ranged from \$0.5 to \$4 million, depending on bloom severity. CONCLUSIONS: Blooms of K. brevis lead to significant economic impacts. The costs of illness of ED visits are a conservative estimate of the total economic impacts. It will become increasingly necessary to understand the scale of the economic losses associated with K. brevis blooms to make rational choices about appropriate mitigation.},

  abstract = {The human gut microbiome is comprised of densely colonizing microorganisms including bacteriophages, which are in dynamic interaction with each other and the mammalian host. To address how bacteriophages impact bacterial communities in the gut, we investigated the dynamic effects of phages on a model microbiome. Gnotobiotic mice were colonized with defined human gut commensal bacteria and subjected to predation by cognate lytic phages. We found that phage predation not only directly impacts susceptible bacteria but also leads to cascading effects on other bacterial species via interbacterial interactions. Metabolomic profiling revealed that shifts in the microbiome caused by phage predation have a direct consequence on the gut metabolome. Our work provides insight into the ecological importance of phages as modulators of bacterial colonization, and it additionally suggests the potential impact of gut phages on the mammalian host with implications for their therapeutic use to precisely modulate the microbiome.},

  abstract = {Bacteriophages, the viruses of bacteria, have been studied for over a century. They were not only instrumental in laying the foundations of molecular biology, but they are also likely to play crucial roles in shaping our biosphere and may offer a solution to the control of drug-resistant bacterial infections. However, it remains challenging to predict the conditions for bacterial eradication by phage predation, sometimes even under well-defined laboratory conditions, and, most curiously, if the majority of surviving cells are genetically phage-susceptible. Here, I propose that even clonal phage and bacterial populations are generally in a state of continuous `phenotypic flux', which is caused by transient and nongenetic variation in phage and bacterial physiology. Phenotypic flux can shape phage infection dynamics by reducing the force of infection to an extent that allows for coexistence between phages and susceptible bacteria. Understanding the mechanisms and impact of phenotypic flux may be key to providing a complete picture of phage--bacteria coexistence. I review the empirical evidence for phenotypic variation in phage and bacterial physiology together with the ways they have been modeled and discuss the potential implications of phenotypic flux for ecological and evolutionary dynamics between phages and bacteria, as well as for phage therapy.},

Several open-source libraries, such as the Sensitivity Analysis Library (SALib), have been published in the recent past aimed at simplifying the application of sensitivity analyses. Still, there remain issues in software usability and accessibility, as well as a lack of guidance in the interpretation of sensitivity analysis results. This paper describes the changes made and planned to SALib to advance the ease with which modelers may conduct sensitivity analysis and interpret results. We further offer our perspectives from the past 7 years of maintaining SALib for the consideration of those aspiring to launch their own software for sensitivity analysis, develop methodology, or those otherwise interested in becoming involved in a project like SALib. These include the value of a community of practice to foster best practices for sensitivity analysis, the potential for collaboration across different software (for sensitivity analysis) platforms, and the need to specifically support the software development that underpins computational science.},

  abstract = {The bacteriophage T4 genome contains two genes that code for proteins with lysozyme activity---e and 5. Gene e encodes the well-known T4 lysozyme (commonly called T4L) that functions to break the peptidoglycan layer late in the infection cycle, which is required for liberating newly assembled phage progeny. Gene product 5 (gp5) is the tail-associated lysozyme, a component of the phage particle. It forms a spike at the tip of the tail tube and functions to pierce the outer membrane of the Escherichia coli host cell after the phage has attached to the cell surface. Gp5 contains a T4L-like lysozyme domain that locally digests the peptidoglycan layer upon infection. The T4 Spackle protein (encoded by gene 61.3) has been thought to play a role in the inhibition of gp5 lysozyme activity and, as a consequence, in making cells infected by bacteriophage T4 resistant to later infection by T4 and closely related phages. Here we show that (1) gp61.3 is secreted into the periplasm where its N-terminal periplasm-targeting peptide is cleaved off; (2) gp61.3 forms a 1:1 complex with the lysozyme domain of gp5 (gp5Lys); (3) gp61.3 selectively inhibits the activity of gp5, but not that of T4L; (4) overexpression of gp5 causes cell lysis. We also report a crystal structure of the gp61.3-gp5Lys complex that demonstrates that unlike other known lysozyme inhibitors, gp61.3 does not interact with the active site cleft. Instead, it forms a ``wall'' that blocks access of an extended polysaccharide substrate to the cleft and, possibly, locks the enzyme in an ``open-jaw''-like conformation making catalysis impossible.},

  abstract = {Bacteriophages, also known as phages, are viruses that infect and replicate only in bacterial cells. They are ubiquitous in the environment and recognized as the earth's most abundant biological agent. They are extremely~diverse in size, morphology, and genomic organization.~However, all consist of a nucleic acid genome encased in a shell of phage-encoded capsid proteins, which protect the genetic material and mediate its delivery into the next host cell. Electron microscopy has allowed the detailed visualization of hundreds of phage types, some of which appear to have "heads," "legs," and "tails." Despite this appearance, phages~are non-motile and depend upon Brownian motion to reach their targets. Like all viruses, bacteriophages are very~species-specific about their hosts and usually only infect a single bacterial species or even specific strains within a species. Once a bacteriophage attaches to a susceptible host, it pursues~1 of~2 replication strategies: lytic or lysogenic. Lytic Replication~ During a lytic replication cycle, a phage attaches to a susceptible host bacterium, introduces its genome into the host cell cytoplasm, and utilizes the host's ribosomes to manufacture its proteins. The host cell resources are rapidly converted to viral genomes and capsid proteins, which assemble into multiple copies of the original phage. As the host cell dies, it is either~actively or passively lysed, releasing the new bacteriophage to infect another host cell. Lysogenic Replication In the lysogenic replication cycle, the phage also attaches to a susceptible host bacterium and introduces its genome into the host cell cytoplasm. However, the phage genome is instead integrated into the bacterial cell chromosome or maintained as an episomal element where, in both cases, it is replicated and passed on to daughter bacterial cells without killing them. Integrated phage genomes are termed prophages; the bacteria containing them are termed lysogens. Prophages can convert to a lytic replication cycle and kill their host, most often in response to changing environmental conditions.},

Traditionally, the routes of brevetoxin exposure have been through the consumption of contaminated bivalve shellfish and the inhalation of contaminated aerosols. However, recent studies using more sensitive methods have demonstrated the presence of brevetoxins in many components of the aquatic food web which may indicate potential alternative routes for human exposure., This study examined whether the presence of a Florida red tide bloom affected the rates of admission for a gastrointestinal diagnosis to a hospital emergency room in Sarasota, FL. The rates of gastrointestinal diagnoses admissions were compared for a 3-month time period in 2001 when Florida red tide bloom was present onshore to the same 3-month period in 2002 when no Florida red tide bloom occurred. A significant 40\% increase in the total number of gastrointestinal emergency room admissions for the Florida red tide bloom period was found compared to the non red tide period., These results suggest that the healthcare community may experience a significant and unrecognized impact from patients needing emergency medical care for gastrointestinal illnesses during Florida red tide blooms. Thus, additional studies characterizing the potential sources of exposure to the toxins, as well as the dose/effect relationship of brevetoxin exposure, should be undertaken.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Increased consumer awareness of the health aspects of the diet has influenced the increased consumption of fruit and vegetables. Due to the fact that these products are mainly consumed raw and are usually not subjected to processes that reduce their microbiological contamination, they become a source of infection and transmit pathogens causing food poisoning in humans. Salmonella bacteria are a serious treat to human health and remain a serious problem in many parts of the world. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review the current state of knowledge regarding the prevalence of Salmonella bacteria on fresh fruit and vegetables. Attention is also given to the mechanisms by which these bacteria adapt to colonize plants. Methods that can prevent contamination of plant products by the bacteria are also analyzed. REVIEW METHODS: The review was based on data obtained from scientific articles published in the Science Direct and Pub Med database between 2007 - 2022, found with the use of the following keywords: Salmonella, fruit, vegetables, food contamination. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE: Data from the literature report that fresh fruit and vegetables are a source of Salmonella contamination through contact with soil, manure, compost, water or staff. SUMMARY: Actions targeting salmonellosis prevention should be undertaken by both the public and private sectors. Government regulations and stricter measures put in place can provide a framework that guides both domestic production and international imports. Periodic training of workers dealing with food is also important. Attention should be directed mainly to production control and less to the testing of final products. Education leading to increased awareness of salmonellosis should be indispensable.},

  abstract = {Theoretical studies of biological populations via analysis and/or simulation of deterministic and stochastic systems sometimes end up drawing conflicting conclusions. Papers purporting to investigate the same dynamics, albeit through different methods, often cannot agree on essential properties of the system being modeled. This problem often arises when trying to compare results that were obtained from different kinds of mathematical models, say those based on differential equations and individual-based stochastic models. While such models can successfully represent or characterize different views of the same phenomena, it is important to know when two different approaches are comparable, as well as any limitations that may be inherent in such a comparison. This survey paper is directed primarily to mathematical biologists whose primary mode of operation is partial differential equations. More generally, we seek to illuminate connections between the two main realms of spatial modeling. We begin by presenting a quick introduction to a class of stochastic spatial models, known as interacting particle systems, which are readily applicable to biological (and many other) systems. We then give examples of how various scaled limits of these models give rise to reaction-diffusion equations and integrodifferential equations. The first case falls under the heading of hydrodynamic limits and the second case is an example of a mean-field limit theorem.},

  abstract = {Existing population models of bacteria and phages have most commonly described single well-mixed reactors. Whilst crucial to gain an understanding of population dynamics, these models are not directly applicable to scenarios requiring multi-reactor models. Using standard approaches we have formulated these models to describe behaviour within multiple interconnected reactors. A model incorporating phage dynamics in wastewater treatment systems was then developed to investigate the potential use of phages as a tool to reduce foaming or bulking. The model couples wastewater treatment dynamics within the commercial software GPS-X (Hydromantis Inc.) with phage dynamics through a newly developed add-on called PhageDyn. Simulations predict that immediately after phage dosing there is a lag period during which no apparent changes are observed, which is followed by a sudden and quick increase in the phage concentration and reduction in foaming biomass. ``Normalization'' without foaming is achieved within 1--2 weeks after dosing. The system may subsequently relapse back to foaming, requiring additional phage dosing, or be ``cured'' such that the added phages keep the problematic foaming biomass indefinitely at bay. Kinetic parameters describing the behaviour of the phages, as well as reactor configuration, are key determinants of the final outcome. The model is useful for predicting potential behaviour and for determining the characteristics of phages that are likely to be successful, assisting in isolation and screening.},

Epidemiological studies have revealed that early-life antibiotic exposure can increase the risk of developing immune and metabolic diseases, and rodent studies have shown that administration of high doses of antibiotics has long-term effects on brain neurochemistry and behaviour. Here we investigate whether low-dose penicillin in late pregnancy and early postnatal life induces long-term effects in the offspring of mice. We find that penicillin has lasting effects in both sexes on gut microbiota, increases cytokine expression in frontal cortex, modifies blood--brain barrier integrity and alters behaviour. The antibiotic-treated mice exhibit impaired anxiety-like and social behaviours, and display aggression. Concurrent supplementation with Lactobacillus rhamnosus JB-1 prevents some of these alterations. These results warrant further studies on the potential role of early-life antibiotic use in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the possible attenuation of these by beneficial bacteria., There is concern about potential long-term effects of antibiotics on children's health. Here Leclercq et al. show, in mice, that low doses of penicillin during late pregnancy and early life induce lasting effects on the offspring, including alterations in gut microbiota, brain cytokine levels and behaviour.},

Because replication by most virulent phage necessarily results in bacterial death, these interactions could also be called predation.

This paradoxical result derives from the fact that resistance to T2 usually arises as a consequence of two nonindependent mutations. Mutant bacteria resistant to phage T4 are very common and increase rapidly in continuous culture with phage T2 owing to an approximate halving of the rate at which T2 adsorbs to and kills these partially resistant mutants. The rate at which these partially resistant mutants then give rise to fully resistant mutants is approximately two orders of magnitude higher than the rate obtained by direct selection. These results are consistent with biochemical evidence that T2 adsorption to E. coli B involves both the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (to which phage T4 adsorbs) and a bacterial surface protein. However, this genetic evidence suggests that T2 can adsorb to either receptor type alone, whereas the biochemical evidence suggests that T2 requires a complex of the two receptors for adsorption to E. coli B. These results also indicate that the effects of genetic background can influence not only the selective advantage associated with particular mutations but also the rate at which certain selectively defined characteristics arise via mutation.},

  abstract = {CRISPR--Cas (clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats coupled with CRISPR-associated proteins) is a bacterial immunity system that protects against invading phages or plasmids. In the process of CRISPR adaptation, short pieces of DNA (`spacers') are acquired from foreign elements and integrated into the CRISPR array. So far, it has remained a mystery how spacers are preferentially acquired from the foreign DNA while the self chromosome is avoided. Here we show that spacer acquisition is replication-dependent, and that DNA breaks formed at stalled replication forks promote spacer acquisition. Chromosomal hotspots of spacer acquisition were confined by Chi sites, which are sequence octamers highly enriched on the bacterial chromosome, suggesting that these sites limit spacer acquisition from self DNA. We further show that the avoidance of self is mediated by the RecBCD double-stranded DNA break repair complex. Our results suggest that, in Escherichia coli, acquisition of new spacers largely depends on RecBCD-mediated processing of double-stranded DNA breaks occurring primarily at replication forks, and that the preference for foreign DNA is achieved through the higher density of Chi sites on the self chromosome, in combination with the higher number of forks on the foreign DNA. This model explains the strong preference to acquire spacers both from high copy plasmids and from phages.},

Since they do not actively self-propel, phages rely on thermal diffusion to find target cells---but can also be advected by fluid flows, such as those generated by motile bacteria themselves in bulk fluids. How does the flow field generated by a swimming bacterium influence how it encounters phages? Here, we address this question using coupled molecular dynamics and lattice Boltzmann simulations of flagellated bacteria swimming through a bulk fluid containing uniformly-dispersed phages. We find that while swimming increases the rate at which phages attach to both the cell body and flagellar propeller, hydrodynamic interactions strongly suppress this increase at the cell body, but conversely enhance this increase at the flagellar bundle. Our results highlight the pivotal influence of hydrodynamics on the interactions between bacteria and phages, as well as other diffusible species, in microbial environments.},

  abstract = {Reproducing cell processes using an in silico system is an essential tool for understanding the underlying mechanisms and emergent properties of this extraordinary complex biological machine. However, computational models are seldom applied in the field of intracellular trafficking. In a cell, numerous molecular interactions occur on the surface or in the interior of membrane-bound compartments that continually change position and undergo dynamic processes of fusion and fission. At present, the available simulation tools are not suitable to develop models that incorporate the dynamic evolution of the cell organelles. We developed a modeling platform combining Repast (Agent-Based Modeling, ABM) and COPASI (Differential Equations, ODE) that can be used to reproduce complex networks of molecular interactions. These interactions occur in dynamic cell organelles that change position and composition over the course of time. These two modeling strategies are fundamentally different and comprise of complementary capabilities. The ODEs can easily model the networks of molecular interactions, signaling cascades, and complex metabolic reactions. On the other hand, ABM software is especially suited to simulate the movement, interaction, fusion, and fission of dynamic organelles. We used the combined ABM-ODE platform to simulate the transport of soluble and membrane-associated cargoes that move along an endocytic route composed of early, sorting, recycling and late endosomes. We showed that complex processes that strongly depend on transport can be modeled. As an example, the hydrolysis of a GM2-like glycolipid was programmed by adding a trans-Golgi network compartment, lysosomal enzyme trafficking, endosomal acidification, and cholesterol processing to the simulation model. The model captures the highly dynamic nature of cell compartments that fuse and divide, creating different conditions for each organelle. We expect that this modeling strategy will be useful to understand the logic underlying the organization and function of the endomembrane system. This article was reviewed by Drs. Rafael Fern{\'a}ndez-Chac{\'o}n, James Faeder, and Thomas Simmen.},

  abstract = {Western Lake Erie (Laurentian Great Lakes) is prone to annual cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cHABs) dominated by Microcystis spp. that often yield microcystin toxin concentrations exceeding the federal EPA recreational contact advisory of 8\,{$\mu$}g liter-1. In August 2014, microcystin levels were detected in finished drinking water above the World Health Organization 1.0\,{$\mu$}g liter-1 threshold for consumption, leading to a 2-day disruption in the supply of drinking water for {$>$}400,000 residents of Toledo, Ohio (USA). Subsequent metatranscriptomic analysis of the 2014 bloom event provided evidence that release of toxin into the water supply was likely caused by cyanophage lysis that transformed a portion of the intracellular microcystin pool into the dissolved fraction, rendering it more difficult to eliminate during treatment. In August 2019, a similar increase in dissolved microcystins at the Toledo water intake was coincident with a viral lytic event caused by a phage consortium different in composition from what was detected following the 2014 Toledo water crisis. The most abundant viral sequence in metagenomic data sets was a scaffold from a putative member of the Siphoviridae, distinct from the Ma-LMM01-like Myoviridae that are typically documented to occur in western Lake Erie. This study provides further evidence that viral activity in western Lake Erie plays a significant role in transformation of microcystins from the particulate to the dissolved fraction and therefore requires monitoring efforts from local water treatment plants. Additionally, identification of multiple lytic cyanophages will enable the development of a quantitative PCR toolbox to assess viral activity during cHABs. IMPORTANCE Viral attack on cHABs may contribute to changes in community composition during blooms, as well as bloom decline, yet loss of bloom biomass does not eliminate the threat of cHAB toxicity. Rather, it may increase risks to the public by delivering a pool of dissolved toxin directly into water treatment utilities when the dominating Microcystis spp. are capable of producing microcystins. Detecting, characterizing, and quantifying the major cyanophages involved in lytic events will assist water treatment plant operators in making rapid decisions regarding the pool of microcystins entering the plant and the corresponding best practices to neutralize the toxin.},

The relationship between OD and cell titer depends on the configuration of the spectrophotometer, the length of the light path through the culture, the size of the bacterial cells, and the cell culture density. We demonstrate the importance of plate reader calibration to identify the exact relationship between OD and cells/mL. We use four bacterial genera and two sizes of micro-titer plates (96-well and 384-well) to show that the cell/ml per unit OD depends heavily on the bacterial cell size and plate size. We applied our calibration curve to real growth curve data and conclude the cells/mL--rather than OD--is a metric that can be used to directly compare results across experiments, labs, instruments, and species.},

To circumvent this problem, specific bacteriophages against immunocrossreactive, non-Salmonella bacteria were used in the sample enrichment step to suppress their growth and improve the performance of an immunochromatographic strip--based detection method for Salmonella. Cross-reactive bacteria were isolated from various food sources and were characterized with a panel of Salmonella somatic O antigen--specific monoclonal antibodies. These cross-reactive bacteria were primarily Citrobacter spp. and Escherichia coli with serology shared with Salmonella serogroups B, D, and F. These bacteria were used as hosts for the isolation of specific lytic bacteriophages. When formulated with the primary enrichment, the bacteriophage cocktail significantly reduced false positives with a broadly reactive immunochromatographic test strip. This was demonstrated in both artificially and naturally contaminated meat. False positives in naturally contaminated beef samples were reduced from 32 of 115 samples tested to zero. In raw meat and poultry with a relatively high bioburden ({$>$}105 CFU/g), the use of the bacteriophage-based enrichment procedure gave improved recovery of Salmonella compared with the conventional culture-based reference method. This was observed when coupled to either test strip--based or selective agar--based detection. The use of specific bacteriophages for the control of immunocrossreactive and competitive microflora during the food sample enrichment step provides a new approach for enhancing the performance of both immunological- and cultural-based detection methods.},

  abstract = {Growth rate plays a fundamental role in microbiology and serves as an important proxy for fitness in evolution. While high-throughput measurements of bacterial growth rates are easily performed in any microbiology lab, similar methods are lacking for bacteriophages. This gap hinders systematic comparisons of important phage phenotypes, such as their amplification rate in bacterial populations and their bactericidal effect, across different phages and environmental conditions. Here, we show that the amplification rate of lytic phages can be quantified by analyzing bacterial population growth and collapse dynamics under phage predation using a parsimonious mathematical model -- an approach termed PHORCE (Phage-Host Observation for Rate estimation from Collapse Events). We found that the resulting phage amplification rate captures the bactericidal effect independent of initial phage and bacterial population sizes and across different growth conditions. Using high-throughput PHORCE, we found that the amplification rates of Escherichia coli phages vary widely by more than three orders of magnitude. Furthermore, our approach suggests that phage--antibiotic interactions are predominantly determined by the antibiotic, and not by the phage. In particular, the ribosome-inhibiting antibiotic doxycycline generally showed antagonism with phage amplification, whereas the DNA-damaging antibiotic nitrofurantoin was synergistic. This framework provides a means to quantitatively characterize phage phenotypes and may facilitate future high-throughput phage screens for antibacterial applications.},

Cocktail is completely self-contained and runs on a Windows 64-bit operating system. By changing the publicly available source code, the program can be developed in the directions that users see fit. Cocktail's models consist of coupled differential equations that describe the infection of a bacterium in a vessel by one or two (interfering) phages. In the models, the bacterial population can be controlled by sixteen parameters, for example, through different growth rates, phage resistance, metabolically inactive cells or biofilm formation. The phages can be controlled by eight parameters each, such as different adsorption rates or latency periods. As the models in Cocktail describe the infection kinetics of phages in vitro, the program is primarily intended to generate hypotheses, but the results can however be indicative in the application of phage therapy.},

Antimicrobial chemotherapy has been a leading cause for the dramatic rise of average life expectancy in the Twentieth Century. However, disease-causing microbes that have become resistant to antibiotic drug therapy are an increasing public health problem. Wound infections, gonorrhea, tuberculosis, pneumonia, septicemia and childhood ear infections are just a few of the diseases that have become hard to treat with antibiotics. One part of the problem is that bacteria and other microbes that cause infections are remarkably resilient and have developed several ways to resist antibiotics and other antimicrobial drugs. Another part of the problem is due to increasing use, and misuse, of existing antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine and in agriculture. When antibiotics are underused, overused or misused, the process of antibiotic resistance is increased. The indiscriminate use of antibiotics, which promotes antibiotic resistance, results from patients' incompliance to recommended treatment and demand, prescribers, irrational use of antibiotics in human, drug advertisement, dispensing doctors and antibiotic use in agriculture, poor quality antibiotics, inadequate surveillance and susceptibility testing. Correcting a resistance problem, then, requires both improved management of antibiotic use and restoration of the environmental bacteria susceptible to these drugs. If all reservoirs of susceptible bacteria were eliminated, resistant forms would face no competition for survival and would persist indefinitely.},

  abstract = {Bacteria have evolved diverse antiviral defence mechanisms to protect themselves against phage infection. Phages integrated into bacterial chromosomes, known as prophages, also encode defences that protect the bacterial hosts in which they reside. Here, we identify a type of anti-phage defence that interferes with the virion assembly pathway of invading phages. The protein that mediates this defence, which we call Tab (for `Tail assembly blocker'), is constitutively expressed from a Pseudomonas aeruginosa prophage. Tab allows the invading phage replication cycle to proceed, but blocks assembly of the phage tail, thus preventing formation of infectious virions. While the infected cell dies through the activity of the replicating phage lysis proteins, there is no release of infectious phage progeny, and the bacterial community is thereby protected from a phage epidemic. Prophages expressing Tab are not inhibited during their own lytic cycle because they express a counter-defence protein that interferes with Tab function. Thus, our work reveals an anti-phage defence that operates by blocking virion assembly, thereby both preventing formation of phage progeny and allowing destruction of the infected cell due to expression of phage lysis genes.},

Elucidating these relations is important both for understanding the physiological functions of endogenous genetic circuits and for designing robust synthetic systems. We describe a phenomenological study that reveals intrinsic constraints governing the allocation of resources toward protein synthesis and other aspects of cell growth. A theory incorporating these constraints can accurately predict how cell proliferation and gene expression affect one another, quantitatively accounting for the effect of translation-inhibiting antibiotics on gene expression and the effect of gratuitous protein expression on cell growth. The use of such empirical relations, analogous to phenomenological laws, may facilitate our understanding and manipulation of complex biological systems before underlying regulatory circuits are elucidated.}

The observed frequencies of all restriction sites in the genomes of all completely sequenced DNA phages (T7, lambda, phi X174, G4, M13, f1, fd, and IKe) have been compared to expected frequencies derived from trinucleotide frequencies. Attention was focused on 6-base palindromes since they comprise the typical recognition sites for type II restriction enzymes. All of these coliphages, with the exception of lambda and G4, exhibit significant avoidance of the particular sequences that are enterobacterial restriction sites. As expected, the sequenced fraction of the genome of phi 29, a Bacillus subtilis phage, lacks Bacillus restriction sites. By contrast, the RNA phage MS2, several viruses that infect eukaryotes (EBV, adenovirus, papilloma, and SV40), and three mitochondrial genomes (human, mouse, and cow) were found not to lack restriction sites. Because the particular palindromes avoided correspond closely with the recognition sites for host enzymes and because other viruses and small genomes do not show this avoidance, it is concluded that the effect indeed results from natural selection.},

The problem is especially challenging for raw pet foods (which include raw meats, seafood, fruits, and vegetables). These foods are becoming increasingly popular because of their nutritional qualities, but they are also more difficult to maintain Salmonella-free because they lack heat-treatment. Among various methods examined to improve the safety of pet foods (including raw pet food), one intriguing approach is to use bacteriophages to specifically kill Salmonella serotypes. At least 2 phage preparations (SalmoFresh{\textregistered} and Salmonelex™) targeting Salmonella are already FDA cleared for commercial applications to improve the safety of human foods. However, similar preparations are not yet available for pet food applications. Here, we report the results of evaluating one such preparation (SalmoLyse{\textregistered}) in reducing Salmonella levels in various raw pet food ingredients (chicken, tuna, turkey, cantaloupe, and lettuce). Application of SalmoLyse{\textregistered} in low (ca. 2--4{\texttimes}106 PFU/g) and standard (ca. 9{\texttimes}106 PFU/g) concentrations significantly (P {$<$} 0.01) reduced (by 60--92\%) Salmonella contamination in all raw foods examined compared to control treatments. When SalmoLyse{\textregistered}-treated (ca. 2{\texttimes}107 PFU/g) dry pet food was fed to cats and dogs, it did not trigger any deleterious side effects in the pets. Our data suggest that the bacteriophage cocktail lytic for Salmonella can significantly and safely reduce Salmonella contamination in various raw pet food ingredients.},

Although the mechanism of defense for some of these systems is understood, a major unanswered question is how these systems sense phage infection. To systematically address this question, we isolated 177 phage mutants that escape 15 different defense systems. In many cases, these escaper phages were mutated in the gene sensed by the defense system, enabling us to map the phage determinants that confer sensitivity to bacterial immunity. Our data identify specificity determinants of diverse retron systems and reveal phage-encoded~triggers for multiple abortive infection systems. We find general themes in phage sensing and demonstrate that mechanistically diverse systems have converged to sense either the core replication machinery of the phage, phage structural components, or host takeover mechanisms. Combining our data with previous findings, we formulate key principles on how bacterial immune systems sense phage invaders.},

  abstract = {Initially described a century ago by William Twort and Felix d'Herelle, bacteriophages are bacterial viruses found ubiquitously in nature, located wherever their host cells are present. Translated literally, bacteriophage (phage) means `bacteria eater'. Phages interact and infect specific bacteria while not affecting other bacteria or cell lines of other organisms. Due to the specificity of these phage--host interactions, the relationship between phages and their host cells has been the topic of much research. The advances in phage biology research have led to the exploitation of these phage--host interactions and the application of phages in the agricultural and food industry. Phages may provide an alternative to the use of antibiotics, as it is well known that the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections has become an epidemic in clinical settings. In agriculture, pre-harvest and/or post-harvest application of phages to crops may prevent the colonisation of bacteria that are detrimental to plant or human health. In addition, the abundance of data generated from genome sequencing has allowed the development of phage-derived bacterial detection systems of foodborne pathogens. This review aims to outline the specific interactions between phages and their host and how these interactions may be exploited and applied in the food industry.},

  abstract = {Selection for phage resistance is a key driver of bacterial diversity and evolution, and phage-host interactions may therefore have strong influence on the genetic and functional dynamics of bacterial communities. In this study, we found that an important, but so far largely overlooked, determinant of the outcome of phage-bacterial encounters in the fish pathogen Vibrio anguillarum is bacterial cell-cell communication, known as quorum sensing. Specifically, V. anguillarum PF430-3 cells locked in the low-cell-density state ({$\Delta$}vanT mutant) express high levels of the phage receptor OmpK, resulting in a high susceptibility to phage KVP40, but achieve protection from infection by enhanced biofilm formation. By contrast, cells locked in the high-cell-density state ({$\Delta$}van{$O$} mutant) are almost completely unsusceptible due to quorum-sensing-mediated downregulation of OmpK expression. The phenotypes of the two quorum-sensing mutant strains are accurately reflected in the behavior of wild-type V. anguillarum, which (i) displays increased OmpK expression in aggregated cells compared to free-living variants in the same culture, (ii) displays a clear inverse correlation between ompK mRNA levels and the concentration of N-acylhomoserine lactone quorum-sensing signals in the culture medium, and (iii) survives mainly by one of these two defense mechanisms, rather than by genetic mutation to phage resistance. Taken together, our results demonstrate that V. anguillarum employs quorum-sensing information to choose between two complementary antiphage defense strategies. Further, the prevalence of nonmutational defense mechanisms in strain PF430-3 suggests highly flexible adaptations to KVP40 phage infection pressure, possibly allowing the long-term coexistence of phage and host. IMPORTANCE Comprehensive knowledge on bacterial antiphage strategies and their regulation is essential for understanding the role of phages as drivers of bacterial evolution and diversity. In an applied context, development of successful phage-based control of bacterial pathogens also requires detailed understanding of the mechanisms of phage protection in pathogenic bacteria. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the presence of quorum-sensing-regulated phage defense mechanisms in the fish pathogen Vibrio anguillarum and provide evidence that quorum-sensing regulation allows V. anguillarum to alternate between different phage protection mechanisms depending on population cell density. Further, our results demonstrate the prevalence of nonmutational defense mechanisms in the investigated V. anguillarum strain, which allow flexible adaptations to a dynamic phage infection pressure.},

The exposure effected a 0.9999 kill of the ancestral population, and survival of the ending population was nearly 50-fold improved. At the end point, a 2.1 kb deletion of early genes and three substitutions in structural-genes were the only changes observed at high frequency throughout the 40 kb genome; no changes were observed in genes affecting DNA metabolism. The deletion accounted for only a two-fold improvement in survival. One possible explanation of its benefit is that it represents an error catastrophe, whereby the genome experiences a reduced mutation rate. The mechanism of benefit provided by the three structural-gene mutations remains unknown. The results offer some hope of artificially evolving greater protection against sunlight damage in applications of phage therapy to plants, but the response of T7 is weak compared to that observed in bacteria selected to resist ionizing radiation. Because of the weak response, mathematical analysis of the selection process was performed to determine how the protocol might have been modified to achieve a greater response, but the greatest protection may well come from evolving phages to bind materials that block the UV.},

  abstract = {Viruses can control the structure of bacterial communities in aquatic environments. The aim of this project was to determine if cyanophages (viruses specific to cyanobacteria) could exert a controlling influence on the abundance of the potentially toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa (host). M. aeruginosa was isolated, cultured, and characterized from a subtropical monomictic lake---Lake Baroon, Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia. The viral communities in the lake were separated from cyanobacterial grazers by filtration and chloroform washing. The natural lake viral cocktail was incubated with the M. aeruginosa host growing under optimal light and nutrient conditions. The specific growth rate of the host was 0.023 h-1; generation time, 30.2 h. Within 6 days, the host abundance decreased by 95\%. The density of the cyanophage was positively correlated with the rate of M. aeruginosa cell lysis (r2 = 0.95). The cyanophage replication time was 11.2 h, with an average burst size of 28 viral particles per host cell. However, in 3 weeks, the cultured host community recovered, possibly because the host developed resistance (immunity) to the cyanophage. The multiplicity of infection was determined to be 2,890 virus-like particles/cultured host cell, using an undiluted lake viral population. Transmission electron microscopy showed that two types of virus were likely controlling the host cyanobacterial abundance. Both viruses displayed T7-like morphology and belonged to the Podoviridiae group (short tails) of viruses that we called cyanophage Ma-LBP. In Lake Baroon, the number of the cyanophage Ma-LBP was 5.6 {\texttimes} 104 cyanophage\,{$\cdot$}\,ml-1, representing 0.23\% of the natural viral population of 2.46 {\texttimes} 107\,{$\cdot$}\,ml-1. Our results showed that this cyanophage could be a major natural control mechanism of M. aeruginosa abundance in aquatic ecosystems like Lake Baroon. Future studies of potentially toxic cyanobacterial blooms need to consider factors that influence cyanophage attachment, infectivity, and lysis of their host alongside the physical and chemical parameters that drive cyanobacterial growth and production.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY Aminoglycoside antibiotics have had a major impact on our ability to treat bacterial infections for the past half century. Whereas the interest in these versatile antibiotics continues to be high, their clinical utility has been compromised by widespread instances of resistance. The multitude of mechanisms of resistance is disconcerting but also illuminates how nature can manifest resistance when bacteria are confronted by antibiotics. This article reviews the most recent knowledge about the mechanisms of aminoglycoside action and the mechanisms of resistance to these antibiotics.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have brought forward the critical role of emergent properties in shaping microbial communities and the ecosystems of which they are a part. Emergent properties---patterns or functions that cannot be deduced linearly from the properties of the constituent parts---underlie important ecological characteristics such as resilience, niche expansion and spatial self-organization. While it is clear that emergent properties are a consequence of interactions within the community, their non-linear nature makes mathematical modelling imperative for establishing the quantitative link between community structure and function. As the need for conservation and rational modulation of microbial ecosystems is increasingly apparent, so is the consideration of the benefits and limitations of the approaches to model emergent properties. Here we review ecosystem modelling approaches from the viewpoint of emergent properties. We consider the scope, advantages and limitations of Lotka--Volterra, consumer--resource, trait-based, individual-based and genome-scale metabolic models. Future efforts in this research area would benefit from capitalizing on the complementarity between these approaches towards enabling rational modulation of complex microbial ecosystems.},

Clearly bacteriophages are important vectors for disseminating virulence genes, but, in addition, do phage regulatory circuits contribute to expression of these genes? Phages of the {$\lambda$} family that have genes encoding Shiga toxin are found in certain pathogenic Escherichia coli (known as Shiga toxin producing E. coli) and the filamentous phage CTX{$\phi$}, that carries genes encoding cholera toxin (CTX), is found in Vibrio cholerae. Both the {$\lambda$} and CTX{$\phi$} phages have repressor systems that maintain their respective prophages in a quiescent state, and in both types of prophages this repressed state is abolished when the host cell SOS response is activated. In the {$\lambda$} type of prophages, only binding of the phage-encoded repressor is involved in repression and this repressor ultimately controls Shiga toxin production and/or release. In the CTX{$\phi$} prophage, binding of LexA, the bacterial regulator of SOS, in addition to binding of the repressor is involved in repression; the repressor has only limited control over CTX production and has no influence on its release.},

Destruction of the murein and bursting of the cell are immediate sequelae. Holins control the length of the infective cycle for lytic phages and so are subject to intense evolutionary pressure to achieve lysis at an optimal time. Holins are regulated by protein inhibitors of several different kinds.

  abstract = {Microbial communities living in the oceans are major drivers of global biogeochemical cycles. With nutrients limited across vast swathes of the ocean, marine microbes eke out a living under constant assault from predatory viruses. Viral concentrations exceed those of their bacterial prey by an order of magnitude in surface water, making these obligate parasites the most abundant biological entities in the ocean. Like the pirates of the 17th and 18th centuries that hounded ships plying major trade and exploration routes, viruses have evolved mechanisms to hijack microbial cells and repurpose their cargo and indeed the vessels themselves to maximise viral propagation. Phenotypic reconfiguration of the host is often achieved through Auxiliary Metabolic Genes -- genes originally derived from host genomes but maintained and adapted in viral genomes to redirect energy and substrates towards viral synthesis. In this review, we critically evaluate the literature describing the mechanisms used by bacteriophages to reconfigure host metabolism and to plunder intracellular resources to optimise viral production. We also highlight the mechanisms used when, in challenging environments, a `batten down the hatches' strategy supersedes that of `plunder and pillage'. Here, the infecting virus increases host fitness through phenotypic augmentation in order to ride out the metaphorical storm, with a concomitant impact on host substrate uptake and metabolism, and ultimately, their interactions with their wider microbial community. Thus, the traditional view of the virus-host relationship as predator and prey does not fully characterise the variety or significance of the interactions observed. Recent advances in viral metagenomics have provided a tantalising glimpse of novel mechanisms of viral metabolic reprogramming in global oceans. Incorporation of these new findings into global biogeochemical models requires experimental evidence from model systems and major improvements in our ability to accurately predict protein function from sequence data.},

Cyanobacteria blooms change the physical and chemical properties of water and cause pollution. Moreover, cyanobacteria release organic matter, N (nitrogen) and P (phosphorus) into the water during their apoptosis, accelerating the eutrophication of the water, threatening aquatic flora and fauna, and affecting the community structure and abundance of microorganisms in the water. Simultaneously, toxins and carcinogens released from cyanobacteria can be enriched through the food chain/web, endangering human health. This study summarized and analyzed the research of the influence of cyanobacteria blooms on the aquatic environment and human health, which is helpful to understand further the harm of cyanobacteria blooms and provide some reference for a related research of cyanobacteria blooms.},

Two sets of experiments were designed to test phage and chlorinated water effectiveness on produce at 2, 10 and 25\,{$^\circ$}C at different storage times (1, 24, 48 and 72\,h). First, SalmoFresh™ was applied to the surface of lettuce, mung bean sprouts and mung bean seeds that were spot-inoculated with a five Salmonella strain mixture (Newport, Braenderup, Typhimurium, Kentucky, and Heidelberg, 105\,CFU/mL) by spraying phages onto lettuce (n\,=\,48 pieces, 3{\texttimes}3\,cm2 per treatment) and sprouts (n\,=\,48 pieces per treatment). A second set of experiments (scaled-up) consisted in the application of phages by immersion to Salmonella adulterated lettuce (600\,g), 300\,g sprouts (300\,g) or mung bean seeds (30\,g) in a phage cocktail (108 PFU/mL) for 15\,min (lettuce and sprouts) or 1\,h (seeds). Another group of samples was washed with chlorinated water and yet another group was treated with a combination of chlorinated water followed by phage cocktail. Each experiment was repeated three times by quadruplicates. After the treatments for spot-inoculated and scaled-up experiments, lettuce and sprouts were separated into different lots (10\,g/lot) and stored at 2, 10 and 25\,{$^\circ$}C; Salmonella was enumerated after 1, 24, 48 and 72\,h. Adulterated phage-treated seeds were packaged and stored dry at 25\,{$^\circ$}C. Salmonella was enumerated after 72\,h of storage. Groups of phage treated mung bean seeds (720\,g) were germinated, and the reduction in Salmonella determined. Results of microplate virulence assays indicated that SalmoFresh™ reduced (P\,=\,0.007) Salmonella by an average of 5.34 logs CFU/mL after 5\,h at 25\,{$^\circ$}C. Spraying SalmoFresh™ onto lettuce and sprouts reduced Salmonella by 0.76 and 0.83 log10 CFU/g, respectively (P\,{$<$}\,0.01). Immersion of produce in a phage solution was better at killing Salmonella P\,{$<$}\,0.05) than spraying it onto the surface, reducing Salmonella by 2.43 and 2.16 log10 CFU/g on lettuce and sprouts, respectively. SalmoFresh™ was an effective biocontrol intervention to reduce Salmonella on lettuce and sprouts. On seeds, although a reduction was observed, Salmonella was able to grow exponentially during germination; therefore, the phage cocktail was not effective on mung bean seeds or sprouts obtained from adulterated seeds. The combination of hurdles, chlorination fallowed by the phage cocktail was the most effective treatment to reduce Salmonella on lettuce and sprouts.},

  abstract = {Phage therapy faces challenges against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella due to rapid phage-resistant mutant emergence. Understanding the intricate interplay between antibiotics and phages is essential for shaping Salmonella evolution and advancing phage therapy. In this study, MDR Salmonella anatum (S. anatum) 2089b coevolved with phage JNwz02 for 30 passages (60~days), then the effect of coevolution on the trade-off between phage and antibiotic resistance in bacteria was investigated. Our results demonstrated antagonistic coevolution between bacteria and phages, transitioning from arms race dynamics (ARD) to fluctuating selection dynamics (FSD). The fitness cost of phage resistance, manifested as reduced competitiveness, was observed. Bacteria evolved phage resistance while simultaneously regaining sensitivity to amoxicillin, ampicillin, and gentamicin, influenced by phage selection pressure and bacterial competitiveness. Moreover, the impact of phage selection pressure on the trade-off between antibiotic and phage resistance was more pronounced in the ARD stage than in the FSD stage. Whole genome analysis revealed mutations in the btuB gene in evolved S. anatum strains, with a notably higher mutation frequency in the ARD stage compared to the FSD stage. Subsequent knockout experiments confirmed BtuB as a receptor for phage JNwz02, and the deletion of btuB resulted in reduced bacterial competitiveness. Additionally, the mutations identified in the phage-resistant strains were linked to multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with membrane components. This correlation implies a potential role of these SNPs in reinstating antibiotic susceptibility. These findings significantly advance our understanding of phage-host interactions and the impact of bacterial adaptations on antibiotic resistance.},
