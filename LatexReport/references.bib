  abstract = {Cyanophages are highly abundant specific viruses that infect cyanobacterial cells. In recent years, the cyanophages and cyanobacteria interactions drew attention to environmental restoration due to their discovery in marine and freshwater systems. Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) are increasing throughout the world and contaminating aquatic ecosystems. The blooms cause severe environmental problems including unpleasant odors and cyanotoxin production. Cyanotoxins have been reported to be lethal agents for living beings and can harm animals, people, aquatic species, recreational activities, and drinking water reservoirs. Biological remediation of cyanoHABs in aquatic systems is a sustainable and eco-friendly approach to increasing surface water quality. Therefore, this study compiles the fragmented information with the solution of removal of cyanoHABs using cyanophage therapy techniques. To date, scant information exists in terms of bloom formation, cyanophage occurrence, and mode of action to remediate cyanoHABs. Overall, this study illustrates cyanobacterial toxin production and its impacts on the environment, the mechanisms involved in the cyanophage-cyanobacteria interaction, and the application of cyanophages for the removal of toxic cyanobacterial blooms.},

We describe detailed characterization of aerosols during an epidemiologic study of occupational exposure to Florida red tide aerosol in terms of its concentration, toxin profile, and particle size distribution. This information is essential in understanding its source, assessing exposure to people, and estimating dose of inhaled aerosols. Environmental sampling confirmed the presence of brevetoxins in water and air during a red tide exposure period (September 2001) and lack of significant toxin levels in the water and air during an unexposed period May 2002). Water samples collected during a red tide bloom in 2001 showed moderate-to-high concentrations of K. brevis cells and PbTxs. The daily mean PbTx concentration in water samples ranged from 8 to 28 {$\mu$}g/L from 7 to 11 September 2001; the daily mean PbTx concentration in air samples ranged from 1.3 to 27 ng/m3. The daily aerosol concentration on the beach can be related to PbTx concentration in water, wind speed, and wind direction. Personal samples confirmed human exposure to red tide aerosols. The particle size distribution showed a mean aerodynamic diameter in the size range of 6--12 {$\mu$}m, with deposits mainly in the upper airways. The deposition pattern correlated with the observed increase of upper airway symptoms in healthy lifeguards during the exposure periods.},

  abstract = {Parasites, such as bacterial viruses (phages), can have large effects on host populations both at the ecological and evolutionary levels. In the case of cyanobacteria, phages can reduce primary production and infected hosts release intracellular nutrients influencing planktonic food web structure, community dynamics, and biogeochemical cycles. Cyanophages may be of great importance in aquatic food webs during large cyanobacterial blooms unless the host population becomes resistant to phage infection. The consequences on plankton community dynamics of the evolution of phage resistance in bloom forming cyanobacterial populations are still poorly studied. Here, we examined the effect of different frequencies of a phage-resistant genotype within a filamentous nitrogen-fixing Nodularia spumigena population on an experimental plankton community. Three Nodularia populations with different initial frequencies (0\%, 5\%, and 50\%) of phage-resistant genotypes were inoculated in separate treatments with the phage 2AV2, the green alga Chlorella vulgaris, and the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis, which formed the experimental plankton community subjected to either nitrogen-limited or nitrogen-rich conditions. We found that the frequency of the phage-resistant Nodularia genotype determined experimental community dynamics. Cyanobacterial populations with a high frequency (50\%) of the phage-resistant genotype dominated the cultures despite the presence of phages, retaining most of the intracellular nitrogen in the plankton community. In contrast, populations with low frequencies (0\% and 5\%) of the phage-resistant genotype were lysed and reduced to extinction by the phage, transferring the intracellular nitrogen held by Nodularia to Chlorella and rotifers, and allowing Chlorella to dominate the communities and rotifers to survive. This study shows that even though phages represent minuscule biomass, they can have key effects on community composition and eco-evolutionary feedbacks in plankton communities.},

  abstract = {A common source of infectious disease is the foods that we eat, which along with water and air serve as a vehicle of delivery of pathogens. That is, these are things that we intentionally take into our bodies, thereby potentially exposing our more internal tissues to these pathogens. Numerous bacterial pathogens are considered to be foodborne. These include but are not limited to Salmonella, several forms of pathogenic E. coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Campylobacter. Some bacteria, rather than cause infection, can form toxins, after growing in food prior to consumption, that sicken people. The most notorious of which is Clostridium botulinum where intoxication can prove fatal. More common but less serious intoxication occurs when certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus produce toxins in food. While preventing contamination of food with bacterial pathogens in the first place is desirable, e.g., by avoiding fecal contamination, it is also possible to minimize bacterial counts in foods following such contamination. The use of chemical antibacterial agents is problematic because many of these agents can also be harmful to consumers because chemical traces often will remain. Alternatives are various physical agents, including heat, pressure, and various forms of radiation as antibacterial agents, which have the virtue of not leaving behind residues, but nevertheless can be problematic because they modify the quality of so-treated foods. When pathogens of concern are only few in type, then more specific, highly targeted antibacterial agents may be employed. One such agent is bacteriophages, which have the virtue of neither modifying food quality nor leaving behind chemical residues. This chapter summarizes the application of bacteriophages in food to enhance food safety. Properties of suitable phages will be addressed and examples of the control of major food borne pathogenic bacteria are provided and discussed.},

Cyanobacteria HABs (cyanoHABs) negatively affect ecosystems and drinking water resources through the production of potent toxins. Furthermore, the frequency, duration, and distribution of cyanoHABs are increasing, and conditions that favor cyanobacteria growth are predicted to increase in the coming years. Current methods for mitigating cyanoHABs are generally short-lived and resource-intensive, and have negative impacts on non-target species. Cyanophages (viruses that specifically target cyanobacteria) have the potential to provide a highly specific control strategy with minimal impacts on non-target species and propagation in the environment. A detailed review (primarily up to 2020) of cyanophage lifecycle, diversity, and factors influencing infectivity is provided in this paper, along with a discussion of cyanophage and host cyanobacteria relationships for seven prominent cyanoHAB-forming genera in North America, including: Synechococcus, Microcystis, Dolichospermum, Aphanizomenon, Cylindrospermopsis, Planktothrix, and Lyngbya. Lastly, factors affecting the potential application of cyanophages as a cyanoHAB control strategy are discussed, including efficacy considerations, optimization, and scalability for large-scale applications.},

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria represent a prevalent category of photosynthetic autotrophs capable of generating deleterious algal blooms, commonly known as cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs). These blooms often produce cyanotoxins, which pose risks to public health and ecosystems by contaminating surface waters and drinking water sources. Traditional treatment methods have limited effectiveness. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a new approach to effectively manage cyanoHABs. One promising approach is the use of cyanophages, which are viruses that specifically target cyanobacteria. Cyanophages serve as an effective biological control method for reducing cyanoHABs in aquatic systems. By engineering cyanophages, it is possible to develop a highly specific control strategy that minimally impacts non-target species and their propagation in the environment. This review explores the potential application of cyanophages as a strategy for controlling cyanoHABs. It includes the identification and isolation of broad-spectrum and novel cyanophages, with a specific focus on freshwater Microcystis cyanophages, highlighting their broad spectrum and high efficiency. Additionally, recent advancements in cyanophage engineering are discussed, including genome modification, functional gene identification, and the construction of artificial cyanophages. Furthermore, the current state of application is addressed. Cyanophage is a promising control strategy for effectively managing cyanoHABs in aquatic environments.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Algal blooms of Karenia brevis, a harmful marine algae, occur almost annually off the west coast of Florida. At high concentrations, K. brevis blooms can cause harm through the release of potent toxins, known as brevetoxins, to the atmosphere. Epidemiologic studies suggest that aerosolized brevetoxins are linked to respiratory illnesses in humans. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized a relationship between K. brevis blooms and respiratory illness visits to hospital emergency departments (EDs) while controlling for environmental factors, disease, and tourism. We sought to use this relationship to estimate the costs of illness associated with aerosolized brevetoxins. METHODS: We developed a statistical exposure-response model to express hypotheses about the relationship between respiratory illnesses and bloom events. We estimated the model with data on ED visits, K. brevis cell densities, and measures of pollen, pollutants, respiratory disease, and intra-annual population changes. RESULTS: We found that lagged K. brevis cell counts, low air temperatures, influenza outbreaks, high pollen counts, and tourist visits helped explain the number of respiratory-specific ED diagnoses. The capitalized estimated marginal costs of illness for ED respiratory illnesses associated with K. brevis blooms in Sarasota County, Florida, alone ranged from \$0.5 to \$4 million, depending on bloom severity. CONCLUSIONS: Blooms of K. brevis lead to significant economic impacts. The costs of illness of ED visits are a conservative estimate of the total economic impacts. It will become increasingly necessary to understand the scale of the economic losses associated with K. brevis blooms to make rational choices about appropriate mitigation.},

Traditionally, the routes of brevetoxin exposure have been through the consumption of contaminated bivalve shellfish and the inhalation of contaminated aerosols. However, recent studies using more sensitive methods have demonstrated the presence of brevetoxins in many components of the aquatic food web which may indicate potential alternative routes for human exposure., This study examined whether the presence of a Florida red tide bloom affected the rates of admission for a gastrointestinal diagnosis to a hospital emergency room in Sarasota, FL. The rates of gastrointestinal diagnoses admissions were compared for a 3-month time period in 2001 when Florida red tide bloom was present onshore to the same 3-month period in 2002 when no Florida red tide bloom occurred. A significant 40\% increase in the total number of gastrointestinal emergency room admissions for the Florida red tide bloom period was found compared to the non red tide period., These results suggest that the healthcare community may experience a significant and unrecognized impact from patients needing emergency medical care for gastrointestinal illnesses during Florida red tide blooms. Thus, additional studies characterizing the potential sources of exposure to the toxins, as well as the dose/effect relationship of brevetoxin exposure, should be undertaken.},

Due to the fact that these products are mainly consumed raw and are usually not subjected to processes that reduce their microbiological contamination, they become a source of infection and transmit pathogens causing food poisoning in humans. Salmonella bacteria are a serious treat to human health and remain a serious problem in many parts of the world. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review the current state of knowledge regarding the prevalence of Salmonella bacteria on fresh fruit and vegetables. Attention is also given to the mechanisms by which these bacteria adapt to colonize plants. Methods that can prevent contamination of plant products by the bacteria are also analyzed. REVIEW METHODS: The review was based on data obtained from scientific articles published in the Science Direct and Pub Med database between 2007 - 2022, found with the use of the following keywords: Salmonella, fruit, vegetables, food contamination. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE: Data from the literature report that fresh fruit and vegetables are a source of Salmonella contamination through contact with soil, manure, compost, water or staff. SUMMARY: Actions targeting salmonellosis prevention should be undertaken by both the public and private sectors. Government regulations and stricter measures put in place can provide a framework that guides both domestic production and international imports. Periodic training of workers dealing with food is also important. Attention should be directed mainly to production control and less to the testing of final products. Education leading to increased awareness of salmonellosis should be indispensable.},

  abstract = {There is increasing concern about potential long-term effects of antibiotics on children's health. Epidemiological studies have revealed that early-life antibiotic exposure can increase the risk of developing immune and metabolic diseases, and rodent studies have shown that administration of high doses of antibiotics has long-term effects on brain neurochemistry and behaviour. Here we investigate whether low-dose penicillin in late pregnancy and early postnatal life induces long-term effects in the offspring of mice. We find that penicillin has lasting effects in both sexes on gut microbiota, increases cytokine expression in frontal cortex, modifies blood--brain barrier integrity and alters behaviour. The antibiotic-treated mice exhibit impaired anxiety-like and social behaviours, and display aggression. Concurrent supplementation with Lactobacillus rhamnosus JB-1 prevents some of these alterations. These results warrant further studies on the potential role of early-life antibiotic use in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the possible attenuation of these by beneficial bacteria., There is concern about potential long-term effects of antibiotics on children's health. Here Leclercq et al. show, in mice, that low doses of penicillin during late pregnancy and early life induce lasting effects on the offspring, including alterations in gut microbiota, brain cytokine levels and behaviour.},

  abstract = {For several decades, antibiotics have been critical in the fight against infectious disease caused by bacteria and other microbes. Antimicrobial chemotherapy has been a leading cause for the dramatic rise of average life expectancy in the Twentieth Century. However, disease-causing microbes that have become resistant to antibiotic drug therapy are an increasing public health problem. Wound infections, gonorrhea, tuberculosis, pneumonia, septicemia and childhood ear infections are just a few of the diseases that have become hard to treat with antibiotics. One part of the problem is that bacteria and other microbes that cause infections are remarkably resilient and have developed several ways to resist antibiotics and other antimicrobial drugs. Another part of the problem is due to increasing use, and misuse, of existing antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine and in agriculture. When antibiotics are underused, overused or misused, the process of antibiotic resistance is increased. The indiscriminate use of antibiotics, which promotes antibiotic resistance, results from patients' incompliance to recommended treatment and demand, prescribers, irrational use of antibiotics in human, drug advertisement, dispensing doctors and antibiotic use in agriculture, poor quality antibiotics, inadequate surveillance and susceptibility testing. Correcting a resistance problem, then, requires both improved management of antibiotic use and restoration of the environmental bacteria susceptible to these drugs. If all reservoirs of susceptible bacteria were eliminated, resistant forms would face no competition for survival and would persist indefinitely.},

  abstract = {Contamination of pet food with Salmonella is a serious public health concern, and several disease outbreaks have recently occurred due to human exposure to Salmonella tainted pet food. The problem is especially challenging for raw pet foods (which include raw meats, seafood, fruits, and vegetables). These foods are becoming increasingly popular because of their nutritional qualities, but they are also more difficult to maintain Salmonella-free because they lack heat-treatment. Among various methods examined to improve the safety of pet foods (including raw pet food), one intriguing approach is to use bacteriophages to specifically kill Salmonella serotypes. At least 2 phage preparations (SalmoFresh{\textregistered} and Salmonelex™) targeting Salmonella are already FDA cleared for commercial applications to improve the safety of human foods. However, similar preparations are not yet available for pet food applications. Here, we report the results of evaluating one such preparation (SalmoLyse{\textregistered}) in reducing Salmonella levels in various raw pet food ingredients (chicken, tuna, turkey, cantaloupe, and lettuce). Application of SalmoLyse{\textregistered} in low (ca. 2--4{\texttimes}106 PFU/g) and standard (ca. 9{\texttimes}106 PFU/g) concentrations significantly (P {$<$} 0.01) reduced (by 60--92\%) Salmonella contamination in all raw foods examined compared to control treatments. When SalmoLyse{\textregistered}-treated (ca. 2{\texttimes}107 PFU/g) dry pet food was fed to cats and dogs, it did not trigger any deleterious side effects in the pets. Our data suggest that the bacteriophage cocktail lytic for Salmonella can significantly and safely reduce Salmonella contamination in various raw pet food ingredients.},

The exposure effected a 0.9999 kill of the ancestral population, and survival of the ending population was nearly 50-fold improved. At the end point, a 2.1 kb deletion of early genes and three substitutions in structural-genes were the only changes observed at high frequency throughout the 40 kb genome; no changes were observed in genes affecting DNA metabolism. The deletion accounted for only a two-fold improvement in survival. One possible explanation of its benefit is that it represents an error catastrophe, whereby the genome experiences a reduced mutation rate. The mechanism of benefit provided by the three structural-gene mutations remains unknown. The results offer some hope of artificially evolving greater protection against sunlight damage in applications of phage therapy to plants, but the response of T7 is weak compared to that observed in bacteria selected to resist ionizing radiation. Because of the weak response, mathematical analysis of the selection process was performed to determine how the protocol might have been modified to achieve a greater response, but the greatest protection may well come from evolving phages to bind materials that block the UV.},

  abstract = {Viruses can control the structure of bacterial communities in aquatic environments. The aim of this project was to determine if cyanophages (viruses specific to cyanobacteria) could exert a controlling influence on the abundance of the potentially toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa (host). M. aeruginosa was isolated, cultured, and characterized from a subtropical monomictic lake---Lake Baroon, Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia. The viral communities in the lake were separated from cyanobacterial grazers by filtration and chloroform washing. The natural lake viral cocktail was incubated with the M. aeruginosa host growing under optimal light and nutrient conditions. The specific growth rate of the host was 0.023 h-1; generation time, 30.2 h. Within 6 days, the host abundance decreased by 95\%. The density of the cyanophage was positively correlated with the rate of M. aeruginosa cell lysis (r2 = 0.95). The cyanophage replication time was 11.2 h, with an average burst size of 28 viral particles per host cell. However, in 3 weeks, the cultured host community recovered, possibly because the host developed resistance (immunity) to the cyanophage. The multiplicity of infection was determined to be 2,890 virus-like particles/cultured host cell, using an undiluted lake viral population. Transmission electron microscopy showed that two types of virus were likely controlling the host cyanobacterial abundance. Both viruses displayed T7-like morphology and belonged to the Podoviridiae group (short tails) of viruses that we called cyanophage Ma-LBP. In Lake Baroon, the number of the cyanophage Ma-LBP was 5.6 {\texttimes} 104 cyanophage\,{$\cdot$}\,ml-1, representing 0.23\% of the natural viral population of 2.46 {\texttimes} 107\,{$\cdot$}\,ml-1. Our results showed that this cyanophage could be a major natural control mechanism of M. aeruginosa abundance in aquatic ecosystems like Lake Baroon. Future studies of potentially toxic cyanobacterial blooms need to consider factors that influence cyanophage attachment, infectivity, and lysis of their host alongside the physical and chemical parameters that drive cyanobacterial growth and production.},

Two sets of experiments were designed to test phage and chlorinated water effectiveness on produce at 2, 10 and 25\,{$^\circ$}C at different storage times (1, 24, 48 and 72\,h). First, SalmoFresh™ was applied to the surface of lettuce, mung bean sprouts and mung bean seeds that were spot-inoculated with a five Salmonella strain mixture (Newport, Braenderup, Typhimurium, Kentucky, and Heidelberg, 105\,CFU/mL) by spraying phages onto lettuce (n\,=\,48 pieces, 3{\texttimes}3\,cm2 per treatment) and sprouts (n\,=\,48 pieces per treatment). A second set of experiments (scaled-up) consisted in the application of phages by immersion to Salmonella adulterated lettuce (600\,g), 300\,g sprouts (300\,g) or mung bean seeds (30\,g) in a phage cocktail (108 PFU/mL) for 15\,min (lettuce and sprouts) or 1\,h (seeds). Another group of samples was washed with chlorinated water and yet another group was treated with a combination of chlorinated water followed by phage cocktail. Each experiment was repeated three times by quadruplicates. After the treatments for spot-inoculated and scaled-up experiments, lettuce and sprouts were separated into different lots (10\,g/lot) and stored at 2, 10 and 25\,{$^\circ$}C; Salmonella was enumerated after 1, 24, 48 and 72\,h. Adulterated phage-treated seeds were packaged and stored dry at 25\,{$^\circ$}C. Salmonella was enumerated after 72\,h of storage. Groups of phage treated mung bean seeds (720\,g) were germinated, and the reduction in Salmonella determined. Results of microplate virulence assays indicated that SalmoFresh™ reduced (P\,=\,0.007) Salmonella by an average of 5.34 logs CFU/mL after 5\,h at 25\,{$^\circ$}C. Spraying SalmoFresh™ onto lettuce and sprouts reduced Salmonella by 0.76 and 0.83 log10 CFU/g, respectively (P\,{$<$}\,0.01). Immersion of produce in a phage solution was better at killing Salmonella P\,{$<$}\,0.05) than spraying it onto the surface, reducing Salmonella by 2.43 and 2.16 log10 CFU/g on lettuce and sprouts, respectively. SalmoFresh™ was an effective biocontrol intervention to reduce Salmonella on lettuce and sprouts. On seeds, although a reduction was observed, Salmonella was able to grow exponentially during germination; therefore, the phage cocktail was not effective on mung bean seeds or sprouts obtained from adulterated seeds. The combination of hurdles, chlorination fallowed by the phage cocktail was the most effective treatment to reduce Salmonella on lettuce and sprouts.},

  abstract = {Phage therapy faces challenges against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella due to rapid phage-resistant mutant emergence. Understanding the intricate interplay between antibiotics and phages is essential for shaping Salmonella evolution and advancing phage therapy. In this study, MDR Salmonella anatum (S. anatum) 2089b coevolved with phage JNwz02 for 30 passages (60~days), then the effect of coevolution on the trade-off between phage and antibiotic resistance in bacteria was investigated. Our results demonstrated antagonistic coevolution between bacteria and phages, transitioning from arms race dynamics (ARD) to fluctuating selection dynamics (FSD). The fitness cost of phage resistance, manifested as reduced competitiveness, was observed. Bacteria evolved phage resistance while simultaneously regaining sensitivity to amoxicillin, ampicillin, and gentamicin, influenced by phage selection pressure and bacterial competitiveness. Moreover, the impact of phage selection pressure on the trade-off between antibiotic and phage resistance was more pronounced in the ARD stage than in the FSD stage. Whole genome analysis revealed mutations in the btuB gene in evolved S. anatum strains, with a notably higher mutation frequency in the ARD stage compared to the FSD stage. Subsequent knockout experiments confirmed BtuB as a receptor for phage JNwz02, and the deletion of btuB resulted in reduced bacterial competitiveness. Additionally, the mutations identified in the phage-resistant strains were linked to multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with membrane components. This correlation implies a potential role of these SNPs in reinstating antibiotic susceptibility. These findings significantly advance our understanding of phage-host interactions and the impact of bacterial adaptations on antibiotic resistance.},
