\subsection{Methods of Modelling Phages and Bacteria}
There are numerous ways to model the interactions between phages and bacteria. Models can be built at a molecular level, where the model simulates the mechanical and chemical behavior of a phage as it interacts with the surface of a bacterium using computational chemistry methods. On the other end of the spectrum, a different type of model can be built where populations of phages, bacteria, and resources can be modeled using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) or Delay Differential Equations (DDEs). DDEs are similar to ODEs, except where when ODEs are calculating the values of the equations at time $t$ using time $t-1$, DDEs can, but don't have to, use the value of the equation at time $t-\tau$, where $1 \leq \tau \leq t$. \newline 

Each type of system has its pros and cons. With the molecular level model, the model is more complex and needs significantly more startup time, simulation time, and is in general much more complex. However, more information can be gained from the simulations and can guide research in creating phages for a certain type of bacteria. The ODE method is simpler and easier to set up, however it can only capture large population dynamics. Certain assumptions about the community interactions have to be made. For example, $\omega$ percent of the bacteria population is washed out. The model can be made more complicated, by modelling each stage of the phage replication and lysis process, or instead of assuming exponential growth, there is a maximum carrying capacity of the population. The model can be further altered by using a normally distributed variable $\textbf{N}(\mu=\omega, \sigma=1)$ to account for noise when measuring the data. Ensuring the use of a seed value will ensure that each run of the model results in the same output. 

\subsubsection{Generalized Lotka-Voltera Model}
The Lotka-Voltera model, a first-order non-linear differential model, is a model that captures the dynamics between predators and prey, with phages being the predator and bacteria being the prey. Any population can be modelled as such:
\[ 
    \frac{d{B}_i}{dt} = {B}_i \left(\left(r_i + \sum_{j}^{N} \alpha_{ij}{B}_j \right) - m_i\right)
\]
where ... 

\subsubsection{Generalized Consumer-Resource Model}
The generalized Consumer-Resource Model models the growth of a population and resource dynamics between a population of bacteria ${B}_i$ and a resource ${R}_i$. 
\begin{align}
    \frac{d{B}_i}{dt} &= r_i{B}_i \left(\sum_{\alpha} \Delta w_{i \alpha}C_{i \alpha}R_{\alpha}\right) - m_i {B}_i \\
    \frac{R_{\beta}}{dt} &= -\sum_i C_{i\beta}R_{\beta}{B_i} + \sum_{\alpha, i}D_{\beta\alpha}^{i}C_{i\alpha}R_{\beta}{B}_i \\
    \Delta w_{i\alpha} &= \sum_{\beta}D_{\beta \alpha}^{i}w_{\beta}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Trait-Based Model}
The Trait-Based Model is a model that takes into account external factors such as the temperature or pH of the system and can be modeled as follows:  
\begin{align}
    \frac{dB_i}{dt} &= \left(r_i - m_i\right) B_i \\
    r_i &= \frac{r_{i\alpha}^{max}R_\alpha}{R_\alpha + K_{i\alpha}}e^{S_i\left(T-T_{ref}\right)}
\end{align}
where $S_i$ is the sensitivity to $B_i$ to factor $T$, and with trade off if $r_i^{max} > \text{ mean } r^{max} \text{ then } S_i > \text{ mean } S$. 

\subsubsection{Agent-Based Models}
Agent-based Models (ABM) model the system through space and time. An $x \times y \times z$ grid (often $z$ is left out for a 2D system) is created and split into smaller subcells containing resources and microbes. Each cell acts as its own tiny environment, where resources and microbes interact within the environment, but not with the neighboring cells. Resources are diffused through the system using a PDE solver for a Boundary Value Problem (BVP). Agents are allowed to move into neighboring grids with a probability $p$, where $p$ can depend on any number of parameters such as nutrient density, microbe density, or stochastic chance. \newline 
ABMs are useful when simulating many individual elements interacting in a system. Chaotic or emergent behavior can arise from these interactions. Chaotic behavior refers to the irregular and unpredictable evolution of a system's behavior due to nonlinear equations, exhibiting sensitive dependence on initial conditions \cite{encyclopedia_of_physical_science_and_technology}. \newline 
Emergent behavior is behavior that arises from the interactions of various agents in a system, that was not explicitly programmed into the system. The behavior can be beneficial, neutral, or harmful, but it can not be predicted until it arises, \textit{if} it arises. Agents can have simple rules, but when interacting with other agents, behavior that hasn't been programmed can arise. Sometimes, people consider systems with emergent behaviors more complex than the sum of their parts. \newline
\begin{align} 
    \frac{\delta R_\alpha(r, t)}{\delta t} = \nabla \left[D \left( R_\alpha, r\right) \nabla R_\alpha \left( r, t \right) \right], r = \left(x, y\right)
\end{align}, where $r$ is a function of cell position $(x, y)$, and $t$ represents time. 
The cellular agents rules are as follows: 
\begin{align} 
    \frac{di}{dt} = r_i \left( \sum_\alpha \Delta w_{i\alpha}C_{i\alpha}R_\alpha\right)
\end{align}, where if $i> \text{ threshold, }\frac{i}{2}$ expands into the neighboring grid cell with a probability $p$. 
The system consumes resources and converts them into new sub-resource types with the following equation:
\begin{align}    
    \frac{dR_\alpha}{dt} &= -\sum_i C_{i\alpha}R_\alpha I \\
    \frac{dR_\beta}{dt} &= \sum_i C_{i\beta}R_\beta I + \sum_{\alpha, i}D_{\beta \alpha}^{i} C_{i \alpha} R_\alpha i
\end{align}. 

\subsection{Biology of Phages}
\subsubsection{Current Applications: Food Control}

When there are a few known bacterial strains, a targeted concoction of phages can be used to control the bacterial population growth in the food. Phages offer properties of microbial control that other methods do not. The process does not modify food quality and does not leave behind harmful chemical residues. Phages are hyperspecific to the bacteria that they can kill, and they don't affect other beneficial bacteria. For example, \textit{Streptococcus thermophilus} is one of three different bacteria strains used to create Emmental cheese. However, Emmental cheese does not use pasteurized milk, increasing the risk of \textit{E. coli}. Emmental cheese producers can add phages that target \textit{E. coli} to the milk during the production stage, while not affecting the bacteria used to produce the cheese. \newline 


Phage cocktails like SalmoFresh\textsuperscript{TM} have been proven to safely reduce \textit{Salmonella} contamination in pet food and raw pet food ingredients \cite{sofferBacteriophagesSafelyReduce2016}, as well as in romaine lettuce and bean sprouts \cite{zhangSalmoFreshEffectivenessControlling2019}. Pet food contains meat and vegetables, where vegetables grown in or on the ground are at risk of \textit{Salmonella} due to contact with soil, manure, compost, and other agricultural runoff from neighboring farms \cite{kowalskaFreshVegetablesFruit2023}. \Cref{fig:SalmoFresh_pet_food} \cite{sofferBacteriophagesSafelyReduce2016} and \Cref{fig:SalmoFresh_lettuce} \cite{zhangSalmoFreshEffectivenessControlling2019} show how applications of phages have reduced the count of \textit{Salmonella} in ingredients used in pet food as well as romaine lettuce and bean sprouts. As such, phages can be shown to control the spread of \textit{Salmonella} in food sources.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Current Applications: Bacterial Infection Control}
One active area of research is the use of phages to control bacterial infections. Due to the specificity of phages, they can be used to target specific bacteria strains without affecting other beneficial bacteria. When sick with a bacterial infection, patients swallow antibiotic pills to help the body fight the infection. Antibiotics work by either interrupting intercellular processes like the synthesis of RNA \cite{flossRifamycinModeActionResistance2005}, by disrupting the structural integrity of the cell wall \cite{tomaszMechanismIrreversibleAntimicrobial1979}, or by inhibiting protein synthesis \cite{vakulenkoVersatilityAminoglycosidesProspects2003}. \newline 
However, antibiotics are not strain specific and indiscriminately kill gut and other bacteria. Common side effects of antibiotics, although usually not serious, include diarrhea, nausea, and headaches. It has also been shown that the effects of early-stage penicillin exposure in mice has found to have a long-lasting effect on the gut microbiome, frontal cortex gene expression, and amygdala gene expression \cite{volkovaEffectsEarlylifePenicillin2021}. Penicillin increases cytokine expression (small proteins used in cell signaling) in the frontal cortex of the brain, modifies the blood-brain barrier integrity, and alters behavior. The mice exhibited an increase in aggression and anxiety-like behavior. \cite{leclercqLowdosePenicillinEarly2017}. Phages can be used as an alternative to antibiotics without the side effects and without affecting the gut biome. \newline

With an increase in antibiotic usage, there has been an increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that antibiotic resistance threatens the modern medicine and the sustainability of an effective, global public health response to the enduring threat from infectious diseases. Common infections, that previously would have been easy to treat, are harder to treat, and can increase the risk of disease spread, severe illness, and death \cite{GlobalActionPlan}. 

One area of research is exploring how bacteria can exchange traits such as phage resistance and antibiotic resistance. Some bacteria are multi-drug resistant, and don't react with the medicine anymore. Phage research is facing challenges due to bacterial strains evolving resistance to phages. Understanding the interplay between antibiotics and phages is essential for shaping future research \cite{zhaoPhagedrivenCoevolutionReveals2024}.

Nana Nguefang Laure et al. showed evidence that \textit{Salmonella Typhimurium} is more susceptible to ampicillin in the presence of phages, and phage-resistance can lead to reduced virulence and decreased antibiotic resistance \cite{laurePhageResistancemediatedTradeoffs2022}. 

Yuanyang Zhao et al. showed that there exists an antagonist coevolution between the bacteria and phages, where the dynamics changed from an arms race dynamic (ARD) to a fluctuating selection dynamics (FSD). Due to phage selection and bacterial competition pressure, when the bacteria gained phage resistance, it lost antibiotic resistance. A genome analysis revealed mutations in the btuB gene of \textit{Salmonella anatum}, with q higher mutation frequency in the ARD stage. A knockout experiment confirmed that the btuB gene is a receptor for the JNwz02 phage and resulted in reduced bacterial competitiveness. Further analysis detected multiple single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutations in the phage-resistant strains. The SNPs potentially affected the membrane components, partially weakening the cell defense against antibiotics. These findings helps advance our understanding of phage-host-antibiotics interactions and the impact of adaptations to antibiotic resistance. The research shows how phages can be used to re-introduce antibiotic susceptibility to previous insusceptible bacteria, preventing costly and lengthy research in new antibiotics \cite{zhaoPhagedrivenCoevolutionReveals2024}. 


\subsubsection{Current Applications: Environmental Control}
    There is interest in using phages to control cyanobacteria blooms. Phages can offer better and safer options than chemical options when trying to control bacterial blooms. Chemical options are indiscriminate, killing cyanobacteria, while also killing other beneficial bacteria and aquatic life, and can eventually seep into groundwater. Although not used to control bacteria blooms, some chemicals like PFAS, also called “Forever Chemicals”, can last a long time in the environment and don't degrade and keep on negatively affecting the environment. Due to the specificity of phages, only the cyanobacteria will be targeted, and will not affect the surrounding areas. Tucker and Pollard found that an isolated phage cocktail collected from Lake Baroon in Australia could decrease the abundance of \textit{M. aeruginosa} by 95\% within 6 days in a lab setting, before recovering within 3 weeks time \cite{tuckerIdentificationCyanophageMaLBP2005}. \newline
    There is evidence that phage-resistant bacteria can influence the population dynamics of other bacteria. It has been shown that the plankton level has been experimentally affected by the frequency of the phage-resistant \textit{Nodularia} marine bacteria. Populations with high phage resistance ($>50\%$) dominate the plankton communities despite a high phage count and eventually out compete other bacteria due to their slower loss in population count. Contrastingly, populations of bacteria with low phage resistance (between 0\% and 5\%) were lysed to extinction, releasing nutrients like nitrogen. This allows for other bacterial strains to absorb the nutrients and dominate the bacterial community. Phages and the lysis of bacterial strains can have a dramatic effect on community dynamics and composition of other agents like phages, bacteria, and resources \cite{colomaFrequencyVirusresistantHosts2019}. Phages have the potential to be used as a highly specific strategy for the control of cyanobacterial blooms, with minimal effects to the environment, and offer control of bacterial blooms, with limited impact to the environment. Usage should be relatively safe, novel, efficient, and sensitive. \newline 
    However, there are issues with using phages to control bacterial blooms. Bacterial blooms can cover vast areas, or be in areas that would be hard to reach like marshlands, applying phages to combat the bloom might be infeasible. If the method of choice was to spray a solution of water containing phages, the solution needs to be shipped to the site and loaded onto special boats to spray the solution into the water, or the trucks need to drive along the shore and spray the solution into the water. The phage density in the solution will have to be relatively high to quickly combat the bloom. These problems provide major logistical problems with creating the phages in a lab or factory, transporting the phages, and finally the administration of the phages to the waterways. Phages can only diffuse through the water, and can't actively swim, so they are dependent on the rate of diffusion and water currents. This will be difficult in marshlands, where the bacteria can “hide” in the grass and crevices created by aquatic life. If the bloom is in a high current area, like in a river or a bay, the water can wash the phages away. Scientists have not yet fully understood the phage infection mechanism, and research into the artificial engineering of phages is limited, making it challenging to conduct studies in this area \cite{grassoReviewCyanophageHost2022, DissolvedMicrocystinRelease}.\newline 
    
    Algae can produce toxins that threaten wildlife, contaminate drinking water, and disrupt local economies dependent on fishing and tourism. In the state of Florida, between the years 1995 and 2000, the restaurant and hotel industry lost an estimated $\$6.5$ million to algae blooms. This accounts for about 25\% of the average total monthly sales revenue in the region from June through October, the months that are most commonly affected by red tide\cite{PDFEconomicImpacts}. During a red bloom event, hospital diagnoses in the county of Sarasota for pneumonia, gastrointestinal, and respiratory illness increased by 19\%, 40\% and 54\% respectively \cite{chengCharacterizationMarineAerosol2005, kirkpatrickGastrointestinalEmergencyRoom2010}, with a respiratory illness visit costing between $\$0.5$ and $\$4$ million \cite{hoaglandCostsRespiratoryIllnesses2009}.
