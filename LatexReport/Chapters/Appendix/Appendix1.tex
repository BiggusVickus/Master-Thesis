Due to the nature of killing bacteria, there are numerous applications where a researcher or an organization might be interested in controlling bacterial populations.

A Food Safety Specialist might be interested in introducing a solution containing a high concentration of phages during food production to prevent the spread and growth of \textit{Salmonella} or \textit{E. coli} in the pet food.  
Alternatively, the Food Safety Specialist might want to promote beneficial bacteria like \textit{Streptococcus thermophilus} used in the production of Emmental cheese, which heat would kill when the milk undergoes the pasteurization process. 

Phages offer properties of microbial control that other methods do not, making them an ideal candidate for some applications.
